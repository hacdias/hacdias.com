Now it would be very interesting to read something similar with the European standard and, of course, a similar tool. Maybe that's an idea for a post.",

I always enjoyed Window UI, at least to some extend.\r\n\r\nThis article shows UI elements present in Windows 11 that date to older versions of Windows.

    "description": "Similarly to his [last article](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/), Jim dives into the concept of website fidelity, which is a way of reducing the amount of resources a website consumes by lowering its fidelity to the original visuals and features. I quite like this idea.\r\n\r\n\u003e Website owners aren‚Äôt necessarily incentivized to start stripping stuff out of their websites in order to support lower fidelities (including a fidelity of zero JavaScript). What you need is like an agent: somebody who works on your behalf as a user and can do for you what site owners won‚Äôt ‚Äî a user agent if you will ü•Å.\r\n\r\n\u003e Note that ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù in this case is not solely a control over the appearance and functionality of the website, but the actual content of the site itself. For example, at full fidelity on a news site you might have an image, title, byline, and short description for each article whereas at low fidelity you might only have the title for each.\r\n\r\n\u003e I want to stress this point: I see the promise of website ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù not just as a preference for less JavaScript and CSS but content itself. Providing users this kind of control would require website owners be involved, as I‚Äôm not sure you could do that well solely as a browser feature or extension.",

    "description": "In the beginning of the week, I tested positive for Covid-19. Even though the symptoms were smilingly gone, yesterday and the day before I noticed my sense of smell was quite odd. I could still smell some things, but not all. In addition, breathing in general had an odd smell. This article was a nice read and explains well how Covid-19 can change our sense of smell.\r\n\r\n\u003e What's more likely, she said, is that SARS-CoV-2 injures sustentacular supporting cells, which are like helper cells for the main neurons that pick up on chemicals in the air and send signals to the brain. They help maintain a healthy ecosystem in which the neurons can thrive, and they help guide the neurons to grow and make the right connections.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e SARS-CoV-2 latches onto specific receptors to infect a cell, but olfactory neurons don't have that receptor. The support cells, however, do. \"Our body's natural immune response is to bring inflammatory molecules to that site to try to kill the invader,\" Patel said.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e But that response can overwhelm the structural integrity of the support cells, and they end up as collateral damage. Without the proper support, olfactory neurons can't successfully relay chemical signals to the brain, effectively silencing smell.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it seems I can smell things well again today, so that's great. Besides, my self-tests are getting fainter and fainter by the day. It's a bit annoying I came to Lisbon and had to miss all company activities. I met some friends and family instead, which was also great. I'll be here until Tuesday.",

    "description": "\u003e New Italian Government not even started yet and shit is hitting the fan already. A surreal thread. üßµ\r\n\r\n\u003e Today Berlusconi claimed he had an exchange of ‚Äúsweet‚Äù letters with V Putin. They also exchanged gifts in the form of vodka and wine. Putin apparently claimed Berlusconi is one of his 5 best friends. Berlusconi‚Äôs party is expressing the new Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\u003e In the meanwhile a photo of Mussolini appeared on the wall of a room in one of the government  buildings. It was then removed ‚Äúto avoid instrumental criticism‚Äù. The l new President of the Senate however claimed that this was ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù.\r\n\r\n\u003e About that. The new President of the Senate has a number of fascist, let‚Äôs say, souvenirs in his home. These include a small statue of the Duce he proudly showed in a video available online. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAQxZuXdyc\r\n\r\n\u003e The new President of the lower house has an history of discriminatory claims against minorities and took explicit positions against sanctioning Russia. At the same time Meloni is attacking people (like me I guess)  who discredit Italian abroad criticising the country.\r\n\r\n\u003e A number of intellectuals which you would normally consider on the left wrote a petition in favour of giving parts of Ukraine to Russia to end the war. The Pope is taking the same position. A number of manifestations are being organised by various parties with similar positions.",

    "title": "Thread by @andrestaltz on Content Monetization in Web3",
    "description": "\u003e This requires long-from writing, but one common myth in the decentralized industry is that content can be monetized. Web3 social nets in particular love to proclaim that they're helping creators make a living. Content is hardly monetizable.\r\n\r\n\u003e The simple/summarized explanation for why content is hardly monetizable is that content is growing in quantity (because of more people online) and quality (because of better content creation tools). This means the supply of content is growing. With supply up, prices go down.\r\n\r\n\u003e By \"price\" I mean that people are less willing to pay for content. This is because the amount of free content is so vast, and often it's also high quality, that it becomes hard for non-free content to compete with free content. Overall this keeps driving prices down.\r\n\r\n\u003e This trend is happening everywhere: textual content like blogs, articles, books, but also music, images, code, etc. TikTok, with content remixability, accelerated content production. Guess what, AI content generation tools will accelerate it even more in the future.\r\n\r\n\u003e People are less and less willing to pay for content. That's how markets work, crypto folks know this. Content supply isn't going to go down, and content demand is somewhat constant because it's capped by attention, and you only have 24h in a day.\r\n\r\n\u003e The only way this equation can change is if there's a high supply of money to spend on content. When you have loads of money to spend, you're more willing to pay if some content is behind a paywall. THAT is how crypto social networks have \"monetized\" content, by airdrops.\r\n\r\n\u003e They create the supply of money to its users to allow them to spend it. Without this supply, the monetization would hardly ever work. And even now, it doesn't quite work. Users are on the platform because they want the tokens, not because they want content.\r\n\r\n\u003e I could write more, but it's late. Bottom line is that I'm convinced that content cannot be directly and sustainably monetized anymore, apart from exceptions. Perhaps attention is a more promising way to monetize. Content is often in service of attention. Content is overrated.",
