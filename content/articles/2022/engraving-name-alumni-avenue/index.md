My university has this thing called "Alumni Avenue". It's one of the air bridges between buildings, but this one is special. On this one, old masters students can engrave their names in the glass. On Monday, it was my turn, right before the graduation ceremony. It was quite an intriguing experience: I've never engraved anything in glass, so it took quite some time to make sure it was clear and visible ðŸ˜… There's some pictures from the graduation, which I will post once I have access to them!
