April is quickly coming to an end and... what a month it was! From Portugal to London, from thesis progress to assisting in classes, from movies to musicals, April was a packed month!

In the first week of April, I managed to visit my parents back in Portugal and it was quite nice to spend some nice with them. Even though I was planning on working on my thesis during that week, it wasn't as much possible as I thought it would be. You might've seen some pictures from those days, but here's a dwarf goat for you:

A few weeks later, Christiaan and I visited a friend of mine that currently lives in London. We went [by train](/2022/04/27/crossed-the-english-channel-by-train/). It was very nice to see her again and meet all of her housemates! It was my fourth - I think - time in London and it was very nice to go back. For some reason, I don't get tired of visiting London.

This time, we watched Mary Poppins on the theatre. This was my first theatre in a _long_ while. I think the last time I watched a theatre I was in primary school. I also had no memory of watching Mary Poppins so we decided to go watch the musical since we were in London. It was... amazing! I wish I could watch musicals more often!

We also went to the Portobello Road Market, and visited some other nice places here and there. I had completely forgotten how London is a gigantic melting pot and you can literally find anything from virtually any other nationality there. There's so much Portuguese stuff. Even our "past√©is de nata" are sold in supermarkets over there!

Besides, it was also a great time to finish the first roll of film of the new camera I'm using. Well, it's not a new camera, it's a "new" camera. This camera belonged to my parents but they thought it wasn't working. It turns out that it is working perfectly.

Other nice things happened during the month, such as going to the cinema, visiting museums, and such. On a different note, my thesis has been progressing well!

I hope you had a great April and let's move together onto May!
