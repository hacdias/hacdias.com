As I usually say, one more month has passed and we're already in June! If everything goes on well, this is the last month of classes and exams of my Master's first year.

It's been very busy, and I'm pretty sure this month will be even more. There's assignments to deliver almost every week for the many courses I have and I have to start preparing for the exams too.

In other news, I visited Den Haag, Maastricht and Tilburg! I also managed to dedicate more time to photography and revamp my [photos](/photos) page. But let's be honest: I'm always changing something on this website so it's not as if that's news.

I leave you with one of my favorite pictures of the month, but I invite you to check out the other ones!
