How should your first day be? It must be something amazing, memorable, but, at the same time, frightful. You don’t have to fear, neither be the superman (or superwoman). We have 5 points to make sure you’ve a great day.

**Talk to people, make connections** - we are all humans so we are made of relationships and social connections. If we lived alone in the world, we would not be anyone, because there would be no one to recognize us. We are social beings, we need each other. So, in your first day - and through all of the journey at your job - you have to meet people. Say “hi” to everyone and see what happens. Just don’t be shy.

**Smile, be happy** - no one likes to work with a dumpish person! Smile to everyone, be fun, but not too much and choose the right circumstances to make a joke. Being friendly and energetic is essential. You don’t have to try to hard, but you mustn’t be too lazy.

**Know the space and how it works** - knowing the place where you’re going to work in the next months, years maybe, is fundamental. Know with who you’re going to work. And most of all, *observe and hear*. Observe the “how to” in the company. How does the things work? How are the decisions made?

**Show interest** - hey, you should be working in a company you’ve interest in, so show it! If you’ve questions, ask them. Ask “what”, “why”, “who”, “when”. Be open minded and embrace the culture of the company, of the people, of the place.

**Be yourself** - the other tips will not work if you miss this one. You *must* be yourself. It’s the most important thing everywhere. You are what you are. You will not pretend to be someone else to make the others like you. Just be yourself, with your way to do things, with your culture, with your visions, with *yourself*.

Are you prepared to the first day at your new job? Let’s do this, dress up - don't be too formal, neither too casual, you're not going to a judgement, right? -, leave home, put your ass in the seat of a car/bus/metro/train/bike and see how it works, talk, ask, walk, know, meet.
