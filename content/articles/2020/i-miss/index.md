Last night before going to sleep... well actually while falling asleep I thought about writing this. It's such a basic poem, but lemme just share it here.

**I miss**

I miss their hugs<br>
I miss my hand on their hair<br>
I miss their hand on my hair<br>
I miss they holding my hands<br>
I miss holding their hands<br>
I miss their face<br>
I miss their shape<br>
I miss their skin<br>
I miss them<br>
I miss physical<br>
I donâ€™t miss coronavirus.

Physical contact is much more important than it seems to us. Yes, emotional connections are important. But emotional connections with physical contact reach cosmic proportions. They change us. Every touch, every cell touching each cell. Every feeling, every moment, everything.
