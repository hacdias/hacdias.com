title: First Attempt at Pixel Art
description: |
  Recently I've been wanting to try out more things in my life. And one of them is more artistic than I'm used to: pixel art! This is where I share how was my first contact with this pixelized world.

Recently I've been wanting to try out more things in my life. Perhaps not recently,
I always have this urge to try out this "new" things that I haven't done before
and that they seem to be... I don't know... interesting to me.

I was surfing the web (does anyone say that nowadays?) and saw some amazing [pixel art][0]
around and I thought: this is really pretty and interesting, what if I try doing some
stuff like this?

I guess that my interest for "drawing arts" isn't new: two years ago I have done some
illustrations just to try out and I actually enjoyed them - at least the process, they weren't
as good as they could be.

So, I started by searching online how to do it and I ended up installing a nice program
called [aseprite][1] to try out this art.

At first, I thought about reconstructing some of the illustrations I've done in the past
and I actually happen to like them. So I've started by doing so.

I reconstructed a wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and a cat üò∏ based on some work I've done before. Clearly
both could have lots of improvements, although I'm really happy with what I've achieved
in so little time.

After that, I moved to something bigger - but it will be the last one of this post. I'm
showing you first the last one I've done but that I don't actually enjoy that much. It's
the central building of my university.

Then - or should I say, before? - I've done something much more interesting: my university
has two twelve floor towers, which are really beautiful. So I believe you already know what's
coming.

I started by drawing the tower itself and the windows. Then, I moved to the building in front
of it and both side buildings. I've played with some shadows and also made sure that I created
a visualisation of what's inside the building.

Perhaps it could have been done better, although it looks good to me. After that, I moved to the
sidewalk and the road in general.

Started by drawing the crosswalk, then the parking lots, the yellow marks and the green area.

What consumed more time was the car. Well... it didn't consume more time, but it probably was the
more "painful" and funny part to do at the same time. I started by painting it and then made the
animation. But then I noticed I didn't like the wheels. And since I did it in a way I had to change
every frame, I had to recreate the whole animation. And this happened like 5 times.

Well... after creating lots of frames and moving the car forward in different speeds, I thought:
"I'm not changing this any more times, let's make it final". I exported it to a [GIF](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36641017998325275674036244184943245870303092763356030368057653459892891025409)
and shared it on [Twitter][2], where I received some positive feedback ‚ù§Ô∏è.

**tl;dr** I've really enjoyed this experience and I'm looking forward to learn a bit
more about this world and sharing the results here. What do you think?
