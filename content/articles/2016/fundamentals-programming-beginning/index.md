This is the first article of The Fundamentals of Programming Using
C series. In this article,
we are going to show you some useful concepts about the programming world. We
will start by using pseudocode (explained below), advancing gradually until we
reach the desired language: C.

## Programming Languages

Just like any human language, a programming language allows us to communicate.
Not with humans, but with computers or any other computerized system.
Programming languages are made of a "grammar" which contains the basic syntax
rules of that language. Using those rules, we can communicate orders to a
computer, it means, teach it how to do something. That is how programs are made.

**Syntactic rules** is a set of must-follow rules that indicate how to structure
the code, that is, how to build it.

There are numerous programming languages: some with a general purpose, it means,
without having a specific purpose. The language C is one example of that kind of
languages. But there are also languages created inside a specific domain like
the [Wolfram Language](http://www.wolfram.com/language/), which is a domain
specific language, multi-paradigm (we will talk about this later) language,
dedicated to math field.

## Algorithms

It is important to comprehend some basic concepts which are going to be
essencial in your whole journey through the world of programming. Thus, you'll
start by understanding what **algorithms** are because you will always be in
contact with them.

**Algorithms** are finite, well defined sequences of instruction that can be
performed by computers, automatons or even humans.

Let's get an example from our day to day: the process of cooking something is an
algorithm. First, we search for a recipe, then we follow the instructions found
on that recipe. That recipe is the key, is the algorithm.

The algorithms can be represented in many ways. We will approach two of them:
flowcharts and pseudocode . These two representations of algorithms are
essential before writing real code; it may help to save time because this
process reduces the margin of error of the development process.

We don't have to draw a flowchart and write the algorithm pseudocode in every
single case. Sometimes, only one is enough. This depends on the working method
of the developer/team.

Flowcharts and pseudocode are universal ways to represent an algorithm: they
don't depend on any programming language. So, they are good for sharing with
other developers.

## Flowcharts

Let's now see the first way to represent algorithms, the flowcharts.

A **flowchart** is a graphical representation of an algorithm that uses symbols
to demonstrate which processes need to be executed in each step.

There are some advantages of creating flowcharts:

* they are easy to create;
* they are easily shared; and
* they help to create mental models.

A flowchart may use a lot of symbols, but we will only talk about the basic ones
to comprehend how flowcharts work. You may visualize them in the picture below.

## Pseudocode

Another way, more similar to the final code, to represent an algorithm, is the
use of pseudocode. Thus, it comes after a flowchart.

**Pseudocode** is a way to represent algorithms that is more similar to
programming languages. But instead, it used the native language of the user so
it can be easily understood for those who don't have no knowledge about the
syntax of a programming language.

Let's take a look at this piece of pseudocode:

```
BEGIN
    VARIABLE CHARACTER recipe <- getRecipe()

    IF haveIngredients(recipe) == true THEN
        makeCake()      
    ELSE
        buyIngredients()      
        makeCake()      
    ENDIF
END
```

The previous code is simple to understand: the pseudocode uses our natural language so it can be easily comprehended. In this moment, I ask you to think about the expressions that end with () as commands.

An algorithm is any order or instruction given to a computer or any other automatized machine. The previous algorithm could be graphically represented as:

As you can see, it's easy to understand. Both pseudocode and flowcharts.
