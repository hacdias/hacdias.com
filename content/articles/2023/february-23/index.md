February has been a total rollercoaster. Nice things and not so nice things have happened during this month. But overall, let's keep a positive attitude towards the future. Let's dive into the events that constituted this month.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Website

I have been making some small changes to this website. Jim Nielsen published this blog post where he added this [plot](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/notes-dot-jim-nielsen-dot-com/) showing how he decides where to post content: if it's ephemeral, he chooses Twitter or Mastodon; if it's more permanent, he chooses his own website. I have also been thinking about this for the past few months.

All in all, the largest change was that I ended up removing ActivityPub support from this website - and this time I sent the required profile "Deletes" to all my followers. I think that I want to move this website to something with a more permanent character and less about random thoughts. Find me on [@hacdias@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@hacdias).

## üçÑ Life

In the beginning of the month, I went to Helmond to get some Portuguese treats. On the same day, I visited the [Kasteel Helmond](https://museumhelmond.nl/kasteel-helmond/) üè∞, which is also known as the "Sinterklaas Kasteel". It was a cute and nice visit, albeit a bit strange because a wedding was almost starting an we did not know about it. Oops.

Around the middle of the month I got my first two wisdom teeth ü¶∑ pulled from the right side. It got so swollen and bruised. Even my neck was yellow, I did not expect that. Healing has been great, but now I just got Covid-19 ü¶†. For the second time - however, it is possible I've had Covid-19 three times, but I did not get tested that one time that I do not know.

In other news, I started going more frequently to the Saturday market in the Kruisstraat, which also has some Polish and Turkish shops with very nice items. I would definitely recommend.

## üéµ Concerts

Before Covid-19 happened, I had two concerts: one in Utrecht for Rina Sawayama, which was incredible. She's a british singer and there's rumours going around that she'll be the Eurovision singer for the UK. If she does, I hope she doesn't get 0 points.

In the same week, I went to Amstrdam for Caroline Polachek. I must confess I went more because of my partner, as I did not know that many songs. However, it was also very nice. It was in Paradiso, which used to be a church, so there were quite nice light effects and frosted glass.

## üçø Watching

During February, I managed to finish "His Dark Materials", which was a very nice series. It followed the story of this movie I once watched as a kid, but it was much better in my opinion. I guess some opinions vary, but I do definitely recommend.

## üéÆ Gaming

I finished "Ratched & Clank: Drift Apart", and it was quite nice to complete. It brought so many memories and made so many new memories. In addition, I started "Hogwarts Legacy" and... don't get me started. If you were a Harry Potter, you'll definitely enjoy this game.

All in all it was a good month, except for the hiccups: wisdom teeth removal and, specially, Covid-19, which was definitely not planned. I hope I start feeling better in the next days.
