Some time ago, I decided to buy a gratitude journal ðŸ““. I have been writing on and off on it for quite some time, definitely over a year and maybe two. Over this time, I think I can say that this has been beneficial for me. And I wanted to share this experience with others.

A few years ago, I ordered a [gratitude journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal) from [Kurzgesagt](https://kurzgesagt.org). It is said that writing a gratitude journal, similarly to other types of journaling, can have psychological health benefits, and I would agree. Each page of the gratitude journal poses two main questions:

- What are you grateful for today?
- What are you grateful for in your life?

This questions forces you to think about what happened in a certain day and what effect those things have on you. Initially, I did not know what to write about, but then I started adding more and more details about events that take place in my life. All in bullet-point format.

By writing these thoughts, these things you're grateful for, you end up feeling better. I don't know how to describe it, but it works. I usually tend to write a page on this journal when I'm feeling more down and it always makes me feel happier.

Sometimes, I also start divagating and end up writing more in it besides gratefulness, more like a diary. For the future, I would like to start writing more frequently and make it a habit. However, I also believe that the trick is to not force yourself to do it. Once you stop enjoying the process, you have to change something as it is not working properly for you.

Once I finish this gratitude journal, I will likely replace it with an empty journal that allows for more freedom. At its core, I will still use it as a gratitude journal. However, I will also have the freedom to write more thoughts that aren't necessarily gratefulness-related.
