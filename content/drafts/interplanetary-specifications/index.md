I gave a lightening talk ⚡️ at [IPFS þing 2023](https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/) on the 19th of April, about the progress we have made over the past months
on building a website for the InterPlanetary Specifications of the IPFS ecosystem. Here's the [slides deck](https://cdn.hacdias.com/media/2023-04-interplanetary-specifications.pdf) and the video.
