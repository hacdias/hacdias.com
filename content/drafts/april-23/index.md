This month was extremely quiet in the gaming department, as I do not think I have played a single game. At least, not anything worth remembering as my brain is not able to remember a single instance where I played. It is possible. I usually go through this cycles: play a bit for some months, stop for more months, come back, and so on and so forth. Now I'm in the low part of that cycle.
