This website contains more things than it looks at first glance. This page contains a list of every page that I deem important that is not on the main navigation. However, it does not show everything. Some things are up for you to <span id='trigger'>discover</span>!

## 🗞️ Feeds {#feeds}

This website provides Atom and JSON feeds for the home page, which combines articles, photos, and book reviews, as well as for each one of the sections, individually. Your feed reader should be able to pick up the feed URL. If it doesn't, you can use the following URLs:

- **Home**: [Atom](/feed.xml), [JSON](/feed.json).
- **Writings**: [Atom](/articles/feed.xml), [JSON](/articles/feed.json).
- **Photos**: [Atom](/photos/feed.xml), [JSON](/photos/feed.json).
- **Readings**: [Atom](/readings/feed.xml), [JSON](/readings/feed.json).

## 📦 Shoebox {#shoebox}

This section is a sort of digital shoebox, similar to [this one](https://gilest.org/shoebox.html). This is a place for some things that exist on this website, and yet, they don't have a correct place to be, a home. They're mostly old experiments from small things I did, or small things I wanted to share and keep available.
