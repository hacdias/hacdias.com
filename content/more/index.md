This website contains more than it looks at first glance. Here you can find a list of every page I deem reasonably important, or interesting, that is not accounted for in the main navigation. Not everything is listed here and they are up for you to <span id='trigger'>discover</span>!

## 🗞️ Feeds {#feeds}

This website provides Atom and JSON for all individual sections, as well as for the home page, which combines writings, photos, and book reviews. Your feed reader should automatically pick up the feed from the page URL. If it doesn't, you can use the following URLs:

- **Home**: [Atom](/feed.xml), [JSON](/feed.json).
- **Writings**: [Atom](/writings/feed.xml), [JSON](/writings/feed.json).
- **Photos**: [Atom](/photos/feed.xml), [JSON](/photos/feed.json).

## 📦 Shoebox {#shoebox}

This section is a sort of [digital shoebox](/2024/01/13/making-a-digital-shoebox/). This is a place for some things that exist on this website, and yet, they don't have a correct place to be, a home. They're mostly old experiments from small things I did, or small things I wanted to share and keep available.
