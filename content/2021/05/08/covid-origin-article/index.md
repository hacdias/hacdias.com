A friend today shared a post titled ["The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandoraâ€™s box at Wuhan?"](https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/). It is still unclear if SARS-Cov-2 evolved from natural causes or from some artificial human experiments. However, I feel this article gives a good overview about the currently known facts and each reader should take their own conclusion. I hope that in the next coming months we will finally have a definite answer to the question.
