I'm thinking of changing how my "photos" section works, or maybe have two different sections. On one hand, I the possibility of being able to just share a random, single photo I liked, like on Instagram. On the other hand, I really enjoy the aspect of curating stories - like [here](https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/) and [here](https://travel.kiralaktionov.com/ameland-2021).

I think it's possible to do both, but is it worth it? Should I invest my time in doing so? I'm gonna work on some ideas and possibly update it on the near future. Who knows?
