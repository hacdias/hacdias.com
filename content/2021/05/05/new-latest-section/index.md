It seems my [column layout](/2021/05/05/css-masonry) didn't last long. As I was writing the post I had an idea: what about a mixed grid with the latest micro, articles and photos? Bingo!

Now the latest section in my homepage contains my latest micro post with full width, then a 2 by 2 grid with the latest 4 articles and a 2 by 3 grid with the latest 6 picture series!
