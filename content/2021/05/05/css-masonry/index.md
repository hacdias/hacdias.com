I just updated my home page to show my last 10 posts (articles, micro and photos). Before, I was displaying two columns: one with articles and one with pictures. But I felt it wasn't dynamic enough as I don't post as many of those.

Now I'm using [CSS columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns) which doesn't make me particularly happy because the order of the posts is from top to bottom and not from left to right. I see there's a masonry grid layour [in the works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Masonry_Layout) so it may be a nice option for the future.

For now, I'm not even sure if I'll keep it like this or change it soon. Let's see. What do you think?
