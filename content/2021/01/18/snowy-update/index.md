Hey y'all! I know I've been quite silent recently and haven't even send out my newsletter. I've honestly run out of ideas, but I hope I can get back on track with that again soon. Also, next two weeks are exam weeks so I will be busier than usual.

A few days ago, it snowed here in Eindhoven and I was quite happy. I come from a place where it doesn't snow and even though I've seen snow before, it's not something that is usually part of my life.

Stay safe! ðŸ¤—
