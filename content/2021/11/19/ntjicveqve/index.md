At this point, I don’t believe it will change anything. But I’m hoping they hear it and have a meeting with me. I see some professors complaining about online education, while others are giving classes on campus because they chose to. I honestly feel like most professors complain about doing it online but it’s also their decision to do it online, which is… weird.
