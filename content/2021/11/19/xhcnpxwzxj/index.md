Just submitted a complaint to my university. Last year I did the same and after a few meetings, nothing happened. But now? Now almost everyone I know - except for the people the have exactly the same courses as me - has some sort of class on campus. Yet, I have none. 2 of my courses don't even reach the limit of people to need to do hybrid education (we're less than 10). But is anyone else going to complain? No! Maybe if more people did complain, something would change. I'm paying for on campus education. If I wanted online education, I could just go to Udemy or edX.
