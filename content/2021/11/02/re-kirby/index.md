  content: I use Kirby CMS and love that it is flexible — I can just write a post
    on my phone, even if I do it rarely. It’s also very fast as the pages get generated
    and cached until they are changed again. Take a look on this, it’s powerful but
    simple. :)

Hey Robert! Thanks for your feedback. I've actually looked into Kirby a few days ago. However, I'm not that familar with PHP anymore, and I feel like I would still need to write extra-complicated plugins to make up for all the functionality I want. Thanks for the suggestion though! I may try it out soon!

I'm now working on developing my custom solution using Go. I already had a backend in Go, so I basically just need to make a few - deep - changes to the code to make it render and cache posts basically. I will write a post on this when it's ready!
