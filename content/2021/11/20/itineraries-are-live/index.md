I just secretly added a new section called ~~itineraries~~ with... well... itineraries! Some are private, as they are in the future. I quite like this functionality: I had to take some time to find some trains I took over the past two years. Fortunately, they were not that many and they were all in my e-mail. Older data I don't have. I did not add any of the train trips I've done in the Netherlands, but maybe later of if I figure out NS API.
