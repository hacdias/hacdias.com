  content: 'For me, the best option to travel long distances within Germany is to
    take the train. I don’t have a car since July, but I have a BahnCard 50 for years,
    with which I get up to 50% discount on (unfortunately very expensive!) train tickets.
    I also recently implemented the option to visualize GPX files in GoBlog. Now combine
    both and I have a new use case: In my diary (for which I also use GoBlog) and
    on my blog I want to be able to display my train trips! There is indeed the tool
    BRouter, where you can click on the stations on the map and the train route is
    then marked. This is a great tool! But for long distances this is too much work
    for me and actually it is enough for me if only the stations are marked and the
    distance between them is shown as a line. That’s why I created a little tool (Bahn2GPX)
    that knows all stations in Germany. Via the command line, I can specify all stations
    and at the end the tool gives me a GPX file with the route. Here is an example:
    This is the route I usually take to visit my family in the south of Germany.'

Uuuh, that's very cool. I'm also trying to figure out if I can do a similar thing for the Dutch trains. In an idea world, I wouldn't have to take any action. However, their API does not let you check where I checked-in with my OV-chipkaart I think.
