This is going to be an intense week! Assuming the week started Sunday, there are 4 deadlines. 2 of them are already delivered. 1 of them is ready to present Wednesday. The other one still needs to be finished and recorded until Thursday. After both of those, I have 4 papers to read. In the meanwhile, there are other work and personal-related deadlines that are worrying me.
