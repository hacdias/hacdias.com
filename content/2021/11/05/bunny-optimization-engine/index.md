Why is Bunny [Optimizer Engine](https://support.bunny.net/hc/en-us/articles/360027448392-Bunny-Optimizer-Engine-Documentation) 10$ per month? That's a bit too much. I must say that I'm tempted of the capabilities to resize images on demand instead of having to upload the right sizes - and then if I wanna change them, I have to reupload all images with the new sizes again. But 10$ is too much for that! There's other services with lower princings though.
