  content: Do any of my readers have unlimited mobile data? If so, what do you do
    to with it? How has unlimited mobile data changed your usage behavior? I picked
    up a good deal a few days ago (by German standards – such contracts are usually
    very expensive here) and the SIM card is on its way to me now. With this contract,
    I have unlimited data available at a speed of 10mbit/s. This is especially good
    if my DSL Internet should ever fail (as it has happened more often lately), so
    that I can continue to work from home and do not have to go to the office just
    to have an Internet connection. But also on the road or in the train I probably
    don’t have to log into WiFi networks anymore and can watch videos, listen to music
    or create a mobile hotspot and do programming without having to think about data
    limits.

I’ve had unlimited data since I moved to the Netherlands. I had very few GBs when I was back in Portugal and it was a bit stressful towards the end of the month to always make sure to not go over the limit. It’s quite nice now. And I can just create a hotspot for my laptop in case I don’t have Wi-Fi somewhere.
