It seems Amazon decided to "deprecate" their GoodReads API in a very silent way. I use the GoodReads API to maintain my [readings](/readings/) page and there's a bug on the script. Thus, I went to the API documentation just to read the following:

> As of December 8th 2020, Goodreads no longer issues new developer keys for our public developer API and plans to retire the current version of these tools. You can find more information here.

I didn't know! I've wanted to drop GoodReads for some time now and this seems the perfect timing! I will probably just try to find some other service with a nice API or build it into my little CMS.

I must say though, that [Readng](https://beta.readng.co/) looks quite promising! I will keep a look on them!

Do you have any recommendation?
