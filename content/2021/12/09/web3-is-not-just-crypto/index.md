  content: 'Matt Baer, found of write.as, compares the web3 with his vision of how
    a real Web 3.0 could look like. Ultimately, a true Web 3.0 will use whatever social
    and technological solutions are available to to improve Web 2.0 shortcomings around
    data privacy, ownership, portability, and control. It won’t limit itself to one
    tech stack, or one social structure. It won’t reset everything to start from scratch.
    Instead, it’ll leverage natural intuition and existing social institutions to
    move us forward. It will mix protocols, software, network topology, the existing
    Web, business / ownership models, and incentive structures. It will be made from
    the bottom-up, not over-hyped from the top-down. It will prioritize open access
    over exclusivity, and revolve primarily around people, not just tech. From what
    I’ve heard about web3 lately, it’s trying to solve a social problem with a technical
    solution (blockchain). But such technical solutions for social problems (for example,
    that artists are not well paid) do not work. Social problems have to be solved
    socially (e.g. by paying more for art, which is also possible without blockchains
    and crypto wallets). I have the impression that all this hype about the web3,
    cryptocurrencies and blockchains only serves one goal: to recruit more and more
    people who will start or continue to invest their money in this thing that they
    are told is the future (without really understanding it). After all, the ones
    who scream the loudest are the ones who have already invested a lot and want to
    see a big return of investment at some point. A huge Ponzi scheme in my honest
    opinion. I will not buy any cryptocurrencies or take part in any web3 projects.
    In addition, it even makes me really angry that so many resources are wasted for
    something like this. If something is to be the future, it must also be environmentally
    friendly! https://write.as/matt/what-would-a-real-web3-look-like'

I just want to give my two cents on this: [web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) or Web 3.0 is not just blockchains. It's an umbrella term for all the new, peer-to-peer, decentralized, technologies. What about IPFS, Scuttlebutt, Hypercore, ActivityPub, Matrix, etc? What about owning your identity, your data? I would even consider IndieWeb - and its form of communication - part of web3.

I guess the interpretation may differ from person to person. It's very unfortunate to see that the media is making it look like it's all just about cryptocurrencies.
