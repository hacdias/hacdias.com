I've been thinking about replacing Miniflux with Aperture + Monocle. I like the idea of using a Microsub client so that I can quickly reply, like or react to any post. The problem is that, unfortunately, aperture insists on **not** fetching posts for two of the websites I follow... I either write my own Microsub server, or go back to just Miniflux.

Has anyone else encountered this issue with Aperture?
