Weirdly enough, the name Tailscale caught my eye and I decided to investigate what it is. I checked their website and it seems that they use Wireguard to do the kind of configuration [I explained](/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat) some time ago. I'm curious: besides the easyness of use, what other [advantages](https://tailscale.com/kb/1086/tailscale-vs-wireguard/) do you see on using Tailscale over a manually configured Wireguard network?
