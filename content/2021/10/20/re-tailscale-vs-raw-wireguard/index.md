  content: Tailscale tries to punch the NAT and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection.
    Thatâ€™s the magic compared to your Wireguard-VPS-VPN. And itâ€™s a lot easier to
    just login and directly connect to each device in your Tail-net than creating
    key pairs etc. Another nice thing is also the option to use Tailscale as a library
    in any Go project. GoBlog (my blogging system) has a Tailscale integration, which
    allows me to access my diary using HTTPS only from trusted devices.
