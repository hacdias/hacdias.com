    All directing to https://github.com/xwmx/nb. I too want to build a CMS! The convenience
    of editing anywhere, desktop or mobile devices, like using WordPress… I think
    that would improve my willingness to write posts, or document stuffs.

Hey! Thanks for noticing that. It's fixed now.

I think you should do it, if you want! I will probably keep going using my "wrapper" and eventually consider a full blown CMS if it doesn't escalate.
