title: Things That I Use

This page is inspired in the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) movement and its main goal is to share with you what things I use on my daily life, from [hardware](#hardware) to [software](#software). It might not be accurate at all times, but I try to update it every now and then to make sure it is up to date.

![Desk at Home](cdn:/2024-06-desk-home?class=fw)

At home I also have a desk with some things. This desk is used by my partner or I when we have to work from home, or if we want to do computer else on our laptops but we prefer to use a desk for it. I'm personally a desk person, and I much rather prefer having a desk than just using the laptop as-is.

### üì∑ Photography {#photography}

In the photography department, I currently own a Fuji X-T5. The pictures that come out of it are fantastic. However, it is a bit of a mess to edit Fuji RAWs due to the way they're encoded. I'm using [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en) for that. Maybe I'll write about it one day.

<div class='tb'>

- **Camera** <span>Fujifilm X-T5</span>
- **Lenses** <span>XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4.0 OIS, XF 27mm F/2.8</span>
