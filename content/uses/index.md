This page is inspired in the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) movement and its main goal is to share with you what things I use on my daily life, from [hardware](#hardware) to [software](#software). It might not be accurate at all times, but I try to update it every now and then to make sure it is up to date.

### üíº Coworking Space

![Desk at Microlab Eindhoven](cdn:/2023-05-desk-microlab?class=fw)

I rent a desk at [Microlab Eindhoven](http://microlab.nl), where I go on my daily basis to work. Being in a coworking space allows me to separate work from personal things. Besides, since my work is fully remote, going to a coworking place is also a way of interacting with others in-person.

### üè° Home

![Desk at Home](cdn:/2023-05-desk-home?class=fw)

At home I also have a desk with some things. This desk is used by my partner or I when we have to work from home, or if we want to do computer else on our laptops but we prefer to use a desk for it. I'm personally a desk person, and I much rather prefer having a desk than just using the laptop as-is.

### üì∑ Photography {#photography}

On the photography department, I currently own a Fuji X-T4. The pictures that come out of it are fantastic. However, it is a bit of a mess to edit Fuji RAWs due to the way they're encoded. I'm using [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en) for that. Maybe I'll write about it one day.

## üìÄ Software {#software}

## üåê Domains {#domains}

This is a list of the domains I currently own, with an explanation for each. These domains are registered in different registrars, namely [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), [PTServidor](https://my.ptservidor.pt), and [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com). I used to have a page dedicated just for this, but I don't think that's worth it. But it's still fun to share!

<div class='box logs'>
  <div class='e'>
    <div><a class='nl lh' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://hacdias.com'>hacdias.com</a></div>
    <div>This is the domain you are visiting right now and I use it as my main domain. <code>hacdias</code> is also my default handle in the Internet, so you can likely find me with that name.</div>
  </div>
  <div class='e'>
    <div><a class='nl lh' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://henriquedias.com'>henriquedias.com</a></div>
    <div>This was my first domain, bought by my father as a gift when I was 14 years old. Nowadays, I redirect it to my main domain. I like to keep it, not just because of emotional attachment, but also because it's my first and last name combined.</div>
  </div>
  <div class='e'>
    <div><a class='nl lh' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://h4c.pt'>h4c.pt</a></div>
    <div>This one I bought after <a rel='noopener noreferrer' href='/2021/12/05/h4c-is-live'>speaking to Sebastiaan</a> about it. It's a short domain for a URL shortener. It's short and Portuguese üáµüáπ.</div>
  </div>
  <div class='e'>
    <div><a class='nl lh' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://hacdia.sh'>hacdia.sh</a></div>
    <div>This was the domain I used to use for my URL shortener. Right now, it serves the same application as <code>h4c.pt</code>. I like to keep it as it combines my handle with <code>.sh</code>. Maybe I could use it for code, or some other programming-related thing.</div>
  </div>
  <div class='e'>
    <div><a class='nl lh' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://nata.cafe'>nata.cafe</a></div>
    <div>This is the domain of the UNIX server that hosts my website, as well as some other small services for friends and myself. It is an homage to the Portuguese custard tart, Pastel de Nata, and caf√©s.</div>
  </div>
