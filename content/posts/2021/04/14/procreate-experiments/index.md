Sometimes I like trying to do something more creative, even if it doesn't work out. A few years ago, I decided that *thing* would be drawing. Since I was into using an iPad at the time, I decided installing [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) and trying some things.

Well, the results were far from good, but at least I tried. I tried making a wide range of things, from *azulejos* (tiles), to randomly colored fruits and vegetables, to other more realistic *things* and people. Now I decided to share them. They're definitely not very good, but I'm proud of trying and what I managed to do. After all, it was just for fun.
