Once again, a year is ending. It feels like it was yesterday that I was first discovering the IndieWeb and adding new features to my website, but that was 2 years ago now. Time has been passing quite fast since _the_ pandemic started.

December was _packed_. I had many different presentations, deliveries and meetings for university. In addition, I finally got my study program approved and got the grades from last quartile. That was good news and I can now focus on finishing the last 3 courses I'm taking now. These are the last classes in the foreseeable future. Then, master's project!

Even though I have quite some university work to do, I've managed to mostly procrastinate and binge watch useless series over the last week. I'm now in Portugal with my family and I hope to be back to the Netherlands soon.

I also had a nice Sinterklaas celebration with my boyfriend's family and got two specially funny things: an **edible** game - which will quickly run out - and a Sinterklaas book for kids 🤣 It's so cute.

I have a few books I want to read, but I either don't find time or just find some excuse. Have to change that habit. I also have a "new" game loaded on my Switch to play so I'll probably pick up on that soon. I hope that soon I will be able to find a balance and start reading more again. I used to read a lot as a kid, but that habit has been fading since I enrolled university.

This year was... interesting in many ways. Sometimes better, sometimes worse, but good overall. I'm looking forward for 2022 and for what it will bring!
