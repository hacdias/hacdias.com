Some years ago, when I first tried doing [pixel art](/2019/04/18/trying-pixel-art/), I ended up making a few other things that I never shared. I now just found them again, and thought it would be nice to share them. They all date from April 2019 and are made after something in my life.

The first one is the beautiful Pirilampos Mágicos (magical fireflies), which are from an annual charity campaign in Portugal. As a kid, we sometimes bought one. The second one is the bedroom lamp that I had in the bedside table during my teenager years. Finally, the last one are the lamps of the living room of my parents viewed from below.
