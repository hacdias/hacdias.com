This year has been passing way too fast. In the beginning, I felt the urge to finish the academic year. Now, I'm only one month away to the beginning of my (hopefully) last year of university. Exciting projects may happen this year and I'm here for it.

July was quite a nice month. In the beginning of the month, I came to Portugal. Then, my boyfriend and I visited Lisbon for roughly a week, which allowed me to see some of my friends, and then we went to Porto, where we had a nice boat ride.

Since then, I've been staying at my parents, and, I'm not going to lie, there's not much to do, but it's been good nevertheless. I will be soon returning to the Netherlands, so we don't need to rush.

I'm hoping for a calmer academic year, but is it going to happen? Let's slowly enjoy the rest of the summer.
