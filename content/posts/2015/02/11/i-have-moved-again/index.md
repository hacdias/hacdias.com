I have moved, again. From now until the end of the times, **coxpe.com** and **henriquedias.com/blog** are gone, and **henriquedias.com** is the unified version of both.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

The quote above tells the **main reason** I have made this change. The content created by me was dispersed on the web so I moved it all to one place. I **took away** some things, trying to achieve the perfection.

I don't want to have a lot of things, dispersed. One thing, one place, is better. Everything is concentrated. Everything is here. There is nothing left to take away, but there is something more to add.

The second reason was that COXPE was receiving a small amount of visits a month and I don't want to maintain two domains with few content.

Because I'm studying I don't have a lot of time to write new posts, much less to two websites. I've also [Pplware](http://pplware.com) and [Pplware Kids](http://kids.pplware.com) to write for. So, unifying this two blogs was the best choice.

## You are using the default theme...

Now, and regardly to the new design of this blog: I'm using the WordPress default theme. Why? There are some reasons.

This theme is **clean, simple, beautiful** and almost **perfect**. It provides a clean design to read. There are advantages for me and for you.

What do **you** think about this change? Do you like it? Or not?
