A very nice and interesting directory of different webrings. According to Wikipedia:

> A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.

Some of my favorites:

- [XXIIVV Webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/)
- [IndieWeb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/)
- [Fediring](https://fediring.net/)
- [The Forest](https://theforest.link/)
