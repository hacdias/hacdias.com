(Nowadays, there’s also an app for this sort of thing, which works quite well.) We do use eIDAS, which we discovered only fairly recently, to file our Dutch tax returns. (In the past, we would have had to mail those in or use basically a password.) Because we’re neither Dutch nor live in the Netherlands, however, we do not have DigiIDs, which means that whenever we need something from, e.g., our health insurer, we still have to request it by phone or (snail) mail, and wait a week or two. Or three.",

And will the EU ID efforts help, because those aim at being able to log into gov services across the EU with your own national government e-ID method, iirc?",

Henrique moedigt mij steeds aan om ergens over te bloggen, en ik hem ook. In mijn geval gaat dat natuurlijk nergens over, maar hij komt met uitgebreide analyses van onze nieuwe OV-chipkaart, OVPay, en problemen met DigiD waar hij als Portugees in Nederland tegenaan loopt. Volg en lees.",
