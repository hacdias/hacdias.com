I am marking this book as "finished" since I have no plans on reading the remaining stories in the near future.

**Update: 20 February 2022**

Just finished the first story, “The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde”. I’ve had this story in my queue to read for a long time and that’s the main reason why I bought this book - I missed the “other stories” part. 

I must confess that this is not my favorite genre and I’m not thinking about reading the remaining stories for now. I hope one day I’ll re-read this story and enjoy it more than I did now.

**Update: 25 January 2022**

When I bought this book, I didn't notice it had 'other stories' in the title. Not only the book contains 7 other stories from Robert Louis Stevenson, but it also includes biographical and bibliographical information about the author.

Nevertheless, the goal with this book is to read the story "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". I will keep the book and maybe in the future I will decide to read the other stories. Or... who knows... maybe I'll enjoy it so much that I will want to read the other stories.
