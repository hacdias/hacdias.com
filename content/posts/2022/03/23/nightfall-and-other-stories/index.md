I am marking this book as "finished" since I have no plans on reading the remaining stories in the near future.

**Update: 02 February 2022**

Finished reading the first story of this book, "Nightfall", which portrays a dystopian and apocalyptic future. It narrates a story where the sun is going to disappear forever and everyone will be in eternal darkness. And what can that cause in people?
