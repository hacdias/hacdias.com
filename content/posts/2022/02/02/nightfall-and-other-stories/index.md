Read the first story of this book, "Nightfall", which portrays a dystopian and apocalyptic future. It narrates a story where the sun is going to disappear forever and everyone will be in eternal darkness. And what can that cause in people?

However, this book is not for me, and I have no plans on reading the remaining stories in the near future. I shall revisit this review on a potential future attempt to read.
