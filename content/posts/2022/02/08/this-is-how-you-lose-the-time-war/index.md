This book is about two characters, Red and Blue, that stand on enemy sides of a time war. In this war, these two enemies end up falling in love until some one's boss discovers this "affair". I gave this book a 3 out of 5, not because the story is bad, but because it didn't resonate with me. In addition, the first tens of pages can be quite slow and hard to understand. I recommend the book for those who enjoy both science fiction and romance though.
