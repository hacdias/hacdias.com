In 2021, I listened to a lot of songs by Marina, Agnes and Lady Gaga, which are mostly pop-ish artists. In fourth place, we have Omar Rudberg, which I wouldn't have known if I hadn't watched Young Royals. We also have some other nice artists, which I definitely recommend.

## ðŸŽµ Songs

Finally, here's the songs I listened to the most in 2021. It is quite interesting to see that the top one song in 2021 is from a Portuguese artist which did not make top 20 of artists of albums.
