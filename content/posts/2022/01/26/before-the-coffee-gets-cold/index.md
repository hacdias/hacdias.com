Just finished reading "Before the coffee gets cold" by Toshikazu Kawaguchi. It is, yet again, a book that falls into the magical realism domain. In this book, the story takes place in a little café in Tokyo. In this café, there is a special seat where people can seat and travel in time.

Traveling in time comes with many rules. Among them, you must drink the coffee before it gets cold and nothing will ever change. The book follows a few characters that end up traveling and the story behind it and their reasons.

It is a very intriguing, yet fascinating concept that the author brings us. It was quite an enjoyable read and I'm [hoping to read](/2022/03/02/tales-from-the-cafe) the second volume sometime soon.
