Today, I finished reading "The House in the Cerulean Sea" by TJ Klune and I was just want to say that it was beautifully constructed. 

> "Don't you wish you were here?"

In the world portrayed by this book, there are people with magical abilities. To some extent, some are not even human. To give this children "proper" education, and since most do not have known parents, they are given to special orphanages.

This book follows the life of Linus baker, an employee of the Department of Magical Youth, who is assigned on a mission to investigate a specific orphanage. This orphanage has very unique children living on it, and... more I will not say. I want my reviews to be spoilerless. 

There is an LGTB aspect to some characters and the fact that the book does not fully focus on that and just treats it as something normal is amazing. A lot of LGBT books focus solely on the relationship and the fact that the couple is LGBT. Here, that does not happen. They exist, they are there and that's... normal.
