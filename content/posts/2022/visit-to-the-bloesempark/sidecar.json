Thatâ€™s quite scary. Time flies!During March, I went to more in-person events than I did in February. I went to an AI Code Session from FruitPunch given by a friend of mine. I also finally watched Spider-Men: No Way Home and I quite enjoyed it. Additionally, I had a few dinners with friends. One of my friends left for their home country and we had a goodbye dinner a few days ago, which was quite nice.I also had the amazing opportunity to visit the Bloesempark in Amsterdam. You should see the pictures - previous link - and visit if you can. It is very very pretty.Yesterday I flew into Portugal and Iâ€™m here for a week to visit my parents. I had to change this flight twice due to other issues, such as Covid, but Iâ€™m finally here!Have a nice April yâ€™all!",
