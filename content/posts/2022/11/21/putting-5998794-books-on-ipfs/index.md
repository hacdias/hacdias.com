This is a good post about the experience of putting that massive amount of books, and therefore data, and the challenges that come with it.

[Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/) claims to be "the world's largest open-source open-data library". As far as I understand, this shadow library does not, by itself, host any of the content. Instead, it is a massive search engine with the collection of the metadata of all these books. Nevertheless, it seems that the authors are invested in seeding the content too.
