This article by Austin is quite interesting. He talks about how programming can be seen as a playful thing, instead of making things that have a hard purpose. It reminds me of the time I made a few [experiments](/more/#experiments) for fun. I should do that kind of programming again: fun programming. And it doesn't necessarily have to be web programming either. Just fun, with fun things.
