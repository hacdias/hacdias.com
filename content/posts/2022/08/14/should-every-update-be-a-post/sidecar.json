      "content": "This part made me want to reply: Listens and watches probably constitute a large part of the posts of this website. Are they useful however? Do they bring anything to you, or to me? Honestly, I don’t think so. However, I enjoy seeing the summary about what I have watched and my listening habits. So they do bring something to you: that summary. However, in my view, many IndieWeb enthusiasts overdo this bit. I also really really love lists and summaries etc, but simply keep track of them elsewhere: in my (analog) journal. Do they need to be put online? Is that the question you want to pose? I honestly never read that stuff if I see it in my RSS reader. Except if there’s context added! Same for bookmarks/links: I don’t care for a random link collection, but I do care for summarized ones with some context. Which ones do you recommend me as a reader of your blog, and why? If it’s just stuff you’re gathering, why not keep it private? So no, I don’t think every update should be a post. It doesn’t make sense Agreed!",

      "content": "That’s exactly what I do, too. There’s no need to keep them apart—Microsub readers or “Webmention parsers” will be able to tell which is which from the markup/microformats used, and will sometimes make the choice for you (cf. the “post type discovery” algo)—although everyone is free to do whatever they like best, obviously. I am planning on merging notes, replies, reposts and RSVPs under the same section. I kind of “hide” my replies behind a link, though, although they’re all there in my feed. And I keep likes and listens separate because, well, they’re currently more of an experiment, I guess.",

      "content": "I’ve realized that trying to strictly follow what is on the IndieWeb wiki won’t work well for me. Thus, I have to invent and change some things to make it work better. The IndieWeb Wiki is a good source of inspiration one could use, but I don’t see it as a guideline you need to closely follow. A lot of IndieWeb sites are too much like social media for my taste. Why replicate social media on your site when you have the freedom to make it better? I was never a fan of “post types”, too many restrictions and sometimes hard to choose between them. (Also, should this post be a like, reply or bookmark? 🤔😅)",
