March has ended a few days ago, meaning that this recap is coming a bit later than usual. Maybe it is a product of the weather being nicer, and the fact that I've been a bit more busy than usual. It's been quite some hectic days!

## üçÑ Life {#life}

At the beginning of the month, we spent a weekend in Antwerpen to see *The Phantom of the Opera* in the theater. It was very enjoyable, but after the show I realized that it wasn't the original version, but the "reinvented" version. That maybe explains why I felt like some things just went too fast or were not extremely well connected. We read the summary of the play after, and there were a few scenes that we feel like were missing.

In other news, we moved apartment. We live in the same building, but went from the 6th to the 18th floor. It's been quite an upgrade to have a 2 bedroom apartment, and a living room/kitchen area where we can actually make a better division between the eating area and the living/entertainment area. In a similar note, we had a few friends over many times, including for fondue ü´ï.

Moving apartments was a journey, including a few IKEA visits, including going one time to Belgium, since we wanted a HEMNES shelf in red, which is being discontinued. Completely sold out in the Netherlands and Germany, but some stores in Belgium still had in stock. We went in the morning and were back before lunch. Success!

## üí™ Health {#health}

Like I [mentioned](/2025/03/30/c25k-completed/) a few days ago, I completed the *Couch to 5K* program, which made me feel very nice. My knees are now much better and today I did one more run. It was shorter and slower, but let's do it like that. I'm going on vacation next week. After coming back I want to work back to the 30 minutes, while ensuring no knee pain.

My wrist is *meh*. I wish I had actually positive news, but I feel like it didn't change much. I did have a few appointments, and have been doing some exercises, but sometimes I feel like the brace is actually making it not improve. It's a hard brace (and not a soft one), so when working, it feels like my hand has to do much more work to be in a good typing position. I'm hoping that vacation will give it the much needed rest!

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

Besides going to the theater, as I mentioned, we also went to the cinema. This month only one time to watch *Mickey 17*. It's a very interesting movie, a bit ridiculous, and there are some characters that have a way too big resemblance of real people in the real world. The author says it wasn't on purpose, but it's uncanny.

We also watched a few seasons of a few series. I want to highlight *Severance*. This show continues to be mind blowing for me, and I'm very curious about what's going to happen in season 3, while we uncover more of the work done by Lumon. We also watched the mini series *Adolescence*, which I realized is not my type of show, but I admire and realize it's a very well made show. Finally, a shout out to *The Residence*, with a bit of drama in the white house.

Enjoy April!
