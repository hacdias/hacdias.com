February is now past us, so it's time for me to quickly recap what has happened last month, this time a few days later than usual. I was hoping to have posted more during last month. However, I made a few updates to the website with the intention of making that easier!

<!--more-->

## ‚úçÔ∏è Website {#website}

On the backend side of the things, I re-added the possibility to [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE "Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere")! Specifically, to Mastodon. This just makes it easier for me to share posts, and thoughts, since it becomes automated. I wanted to do something similar for Bluesky, but their API ended up not being as simple as the one from Mastodon, so I haven't done it yet.

On the frontend side of things, I added a new category and removed another one. I had already mentioned I wanted to remove the graphics category, since I didn't fit it very fitting, nor important. Instead, I now have [fragments](/fragments/). This should encompass all other types of posts, like shorter thoughts, notes, etc. I also cleaned up a few other things, here and there ü´ß.

## üçÑ Life {#life}

We went to London for a few days to visit a friend of ours that lives there, as well as just having some fun. I have been to London a few times at this point, and it never disappoints. I really want to visit more of the UK, specifically towards Scotland. So that's on the list!

We [took](/2025/02/13/london/) the train from Rotterdam to London and it was a pleasant journey. On the way back, the St. Pancras station felt quite a bit crowded after passport control. I have read somewhere they're working on increasing the international train area, so that's a good thing.

In London, we visited the Harry Potter Studios, which was a first to me. It was incredible to see how the sets were done, including some effect demonstrations. We visited Richmond, Chiswick, went to different caf√©s, walked around, enjoyed the time, and bought a [ridiculous pillow](/2025/02/14/elizabeth-pillow/)!

On other news, we got a new apartment! It's in the same building, which I hope will make moving way much easier. We're moving from the 6th to the 18th floor. This will be translated in much more natural light, a much better view, and also a second bedroom. Exciting times!

## üí™ Health {#health}

Running is going better than I ever expected it to go. I've been following the plan, even though I ended up repeating a week after making a small pause during London. I'm now at the end of week 6. From now on, all runs will be without intervals, so I'm very curious to see how it will go.

In terms of my wrist, it is feeling better after the [injection](/2025/02/12/optimistic-wrist/). The injection made it feel much better actually. Now I got a custom made splint to hold my thumb into place to try giving the "other" tendon some rest. I'm not 100% convinced, but I'm nevertheless cautiously optimistic.

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

Something I didn't mention above was something else we did in London: we went to the theater. It's a must! We saw *Stranger Things: The First Shadow*. In this piece we learned the story of number 001, a sort of prequel to the Netflix series. I was positively surprised with all the effects, from practical to special. At some point I didn't even know what was real and what was fake. A fantastic piece to be seen! 

When it comes to movies, we only watched a single movie. With so many other things happening, we didn't end up going to the cinema a single time. We just watched *Super Mario Bros* on the train to London and I have a very strong feeling that I had already watched it.

On the series side, we did watch a few things. We ended *Ted Lasso*, which was quite heartwarming. We also watched the new season of *Knokke Off*, a Belgian-Dutch series, and watched the first seasons of *Surface* and *Ghosts*. *Surface* has surprised me, especially the second season which has started recently. We're now actively watching *Surface*, *Severance*, *White Lotus* and *Ghosts*.

Happy March!
