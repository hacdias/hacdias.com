A few days ago, I competed the *Couch to 5K* program, which is a running program designed to slowly build one's up to run 30 minutes, or 5 kilometers. Depends a bit on whether you follow the timed or the metric program. I [decided](/2025/01/23/running/) to start it back in January, and now, two months later, I'm glad to say I completed it!

It's crazy to think how I went from a very annoying Achilles tendinitis that has been following me the past few years, to running 5 kilometers. If you've been reading my posts for some time, you may know I have had an Achilles tendinitis in both of my legs and it was a struggle to get them to improve. When I started this running program, that was my #1 fear: that these complaints would come back! The truth is that if it happens once, you're just more prone to get it again.

Either way, I'm very glad I managed the whole program with very minimal complaints. I've actually only had Achilles complains one time after the first run on the second week. I immediately introduced foam rolling in my post-run routine and never had issues again. Before each run, I do a few minutes of dynamic stretching, and after the run a few minutes of dynamic and static stretching, ending with foam rolling my calves. So far, so good.

Will I continue running? That is the important question. I did really enjoy it, and Chris came with me in some of the runs. Considering that he broke his ankle last year, it's also amazing to see how much progress he's had since then. So in general, I'd say that my goal is to keep running. But first, I need to address my new complaint at hand: knees!

The only complaint I've had during this past weeks' runs were my knees. Not during the run, but especially right after, and then lingering the next days. I've noticed it happened especially if I did go faster. The first noticeable time was two weeks ago Friday when I did my first 5K within 30 minutes. The run after I went slower, and I had null complaints after. Sadly, in the last run, I apparently went faster again, and now I'm going through the consequences.

So, yes, I want to keep running. I just need to precisely identify what's causing the pain and address it. Is it form? Is it speed? Is it me going faster making me run in a weird way and putting more pressure in the knees? Who knows. I plan on going for at least two runs next week and I'll make a conscious effort to go slower to see how it goes. In either case, I will be very cautious.

All in all, I consider it a success: I run 5 kilometers and finished the program! I don't think I'd last year believe that I would now be running 5 kilometers without a single Achilles ache.
