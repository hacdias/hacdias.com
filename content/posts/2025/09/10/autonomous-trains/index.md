A few days ago, I was able to tick one more item from my [impossible list](/impossible-list/): traveling on the front cabin of a subway train. When I wrote that, I meant that I wanted to see the view from the conductor's point of view on a tunnel. Since I was in Copenhagen and they have a fully autonomous metro, I did not need to go far to complete that wish.

Originally, I envisioned this item being completed as a shy Henrique asking a conductor for their permission to be in the cabin for a short trip, and how much of a security nightmare that would be and likely never happen. I would still love to see it one day, but traveling on an autonomous metro was incredible enough.

I also want to add that I've traveled with the DLR in London. However, my impossible list item was very specifically about an underground metro. There's something about seeing the tunnel go by. I do admire people that do this for a job and see the insides of a tunnel for hours and hours a day, especially in a fully underground metro system.
