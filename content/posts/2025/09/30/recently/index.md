The ninth month of the year is coming to an end, and I feel like 2025 is flying by. I feel like it was a calmer month in comparison to the previous months, but maybe that's a false impression. Let's see.

## üçÑ Life {#life}

At the beginning of the month, Chris and I went to Copenhagen. He's been there before, but I had never been in any Scandinavian country so far. It was beautiful. In some ways very similar to the Netherlands, from the bike lanes, to the canals - which were apparently made to resemble Amsterdam -, and the general feels.

However, there were also differences: food was generally much better, there was just a general charm, a cleanliness that I had never seen before. I would definitely visit again, and maybe work remotely for a month or two. Who knows? We also quickly visited Malm√∂ as a day trip, which was also quite nice.

After coming back, we went to a Portuguese restaurant in Amsterdam which we needed to book around a month and a half in advance: [Dona](https://www.donarestaurant.com/)! Dona is run by a couple: the Portuguese chef and the Dutch server. The atmosphere was incredible, the food was on point, and it overall just a very nice experience. I'll definitely come back once the Chef's menu has rotated.

Later in the month, De Wielewaal, a once forbidden and secret terrain in Eindhoven, opened as park. This terrain was originally from the Philips family, and has been private property for the past hundred years. It was incredible to be at the opening ceremony and being one of the first people in such a long period of time to be there. De Wielewaal was once a heathland, but is now a forest with a unique ecosystem.

## üí™ Health {#health}

This month I kept focusing on my schedule: running, strength training and yoga. It has been going well. I've also increased some of the weights in my arm exercises, and I've noticed my left arm is a bit more tired. Fortunately, the arm being tired doesn't mean my wrist is hurting again. However, I will be on the lookout and make sure to not overdo it.

## üìö Reading {#reading}

I have been [reading](/readings/) more in general. I want to highlight a Dutch book I read last month about democracy, and how we could improve it: [*Waarom We Politiek Niet Alleen Aan Politici Kunnen Overlaten*](/2025/09/20/waarom-we-politiek-niet-alleen-aan-politici-kunnen-overlaten/) (*Why we can't leave politics to politicians alone*). It touches in very interesting topics and how we, as "normal" people, could have more say into what happens in our land.

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

We went twice to the cinema this month, where we watched *Honey Don't* and *Weapons*. They were both good, on their own way. But I'd say that *Honey Don't* impressed me the most. When it comes to series, we finished a few things: *Invasion*, and the latest seasons of *Wednesday*, *Foundation*, *Abbott Elementary*, *My Life with the Walter Boys*; and we also started *The Morning Show*.

Next week I'll be on vacation, which I'm looking forward. In the meanwhile, take care!
