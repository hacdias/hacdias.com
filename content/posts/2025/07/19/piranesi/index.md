This was the first book I read by Susanna Clarke. I heard about it at a friend's birthday party, after someone gifted this book to the birthday person. After seeing how gorgeous the cover was, and hearing a little bit about the story, I decided to buy it!

*Piranesi* did not disappoint. The book falls into the [speculative fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction) genre, which is a genre I have read more often in the past years. It is sort of within the same category as magical realism, where reality and magic blend together in a subtle way.

At the beginning of the book, I was not yet very convinced, but I think that happens every time I start a book nowadays. As I read more and more, it became more and more interesting to follow *Piranesi*'s story in the place where he lived, a place he calls "The House", where you can find many statues, as well as unexpected events, such as tides, waves, parts of the ocean.

I think the book was quite well written, and the story becomes more and more engaging as time goes on. In addition, I think there were quite a lot of questions about one's identity and what makes one's identity. Either way, I will not say anything else, since that'd be a spoiler! I do recommend it.
