It is no secret that I enjoy tracking things, whether it is books I [read](/readings/), things I [watched](/watches/), or places I have [been](/trips/). When I travel, I track my flights, and that is, as far as I know, something a lot of people do. It also means that there are many tools out there for it. But when it comes to trains, I have never found a very reliable solution... until now!

I have recently discovered [viaduct](https://viaduct.world), a web app where I can track my train trips. And the best part is: it integrates with the train schedules of some countries. I'm not exactly sure which, but all countries in Europe I tried to add, I had a schedule for.

I spent some hours the past week importing a lot of data - around 350 trips - into viaduct. Sadly, there was no way to automatically import all of them, and not all of the data I had was extremely structured. So the truth is that some trains might not have the exact right hours of departure and such, but yeah, it was the best I could do.

Another nicety of viaduct is the statistics: the statistics come in many ways and forms. And what's nice about statistics is plucking a few interesting facts out of it:

- I have visited at least 110 stations across 12 countries so far: Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Austria, Japan, France, Spain, Czechia and United Kingdom.
- I have traveled with around 28 different operators, being NS - the Dutch Railways - the one I traveled with the most, followed by CP, the Portuguese Rail services.
- I have traveled at least 40.000 km by rail. I say at least because I could not include any travels from 2023 since I lacked the data. That was a mistake from my part from not having stored it.
- I have ridden 45% of the railway network in the Netherlands. That is crazy. Ad second place there's Portugal with 28% coverage.

It's very nice to see. My plan is, from now on, to just track my train rides as I take them. Considering I live in the Netherlands, and how reliable viaduct has been with the schedules, it's quite effortless. And maybe I should make it a goal to cover 100% of the Dutch railway network. I have a subscription for free train rides on the weekend, so... why not? Discover a bit more of the Netherlands.

With all of this data, I am now also able to better generate my [trips](/trips/) page with better, and more reliable information. When you click on one of the trips, you see the flights, busses and trains I took. Now, it has been augmented to include everything coming out the exports of viaduct, and Flighty - the app I use to track my flights.

Just to say... I do recommend viaduct if you like to track things!
