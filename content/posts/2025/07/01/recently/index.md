One more month has passed, and June is now away from us. We've officially entered the last half of the year, at least when it comes to counting months. It was quite a busy month, with travel, new job, events, and the heat! Let's take a look.

## üçÑ Life {#life}

At the beginning of the month, we traveled to Madeira, a Portuguese island in the Atlantic ocean, not very far from the coast of Africa. It is full of microclimates and it is also the home of the subtropical [Laurissilva forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurisilva_of_Madeira). If you've been following my blog, you've probably [come](/2025/06/13/magical-mist/) [across](/2025/06/13/laurissilva/) [many](/2025/06/14/pico-do-areeiro/) [of](/2025/06/19/banana-island/) [the](/2025/06/14/perspective/) [photos](/2025/06/15/solitude/) I [have](/2025/06/15/tranquility/) [released](/2025/06/17/untitled/) last month.

Chris and I visited with my parents, with a layover in Lisbon. The layover was perhaps too long, and for one reason or another, my mind thought that Lisbon's airport was a bit bigger than it actually was. It was worth it though! Madeira is abundant with breathtaking scenery and I would definitely recommend paying a visit!

On a more technical side, and despite [trying](/2025/06/14/maintaining-open-source-projects/) to find new maintainers for the project, I have been giving [File Browser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) some needed love. Especially when it comes to addressing quite a few security vulnerabilities that have been found by a security researcher from [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/).

Last weekend, I also participated in the [FietsZwerm040](https://fietszwerm040.nl/), which is a demonstration for road safety for the bike. We all bikes as one through a route that shows some of the not-so-well-thought-of-intersections and other road features for the bike. It was also quite nice that we were sometimes allowed to bike on the actual normal road and even on the bus lane.

Lastly, I started a new job at [Animo](https://animo.id/). Just like my previous job, it is also in the digital identity workspace, but with some more open source focus, which I missed. The offices are in Utrecht, and I go there one or twice a week, and work from home the rest of the days. It's been very nice and pleasant!

## üí™ Health {#health}

My wrist is getting better. I had one last - I hope - appointment with the physiotherapy. I'm just going to keep working on the exercises, and trying to build up strength. I'm positive about it. When it comes to other sports, I'm trying to be more consistent with my home functional strength training workouts, but it's not yet as consistent as I'd love it to. I'll get there though!

## üìö Reading {#reading}

I finished reading *Waiting for the Flood*. It was a good book in the sense that it was very heart warming and the storyline was nice to follow along. Not a very busy book with an extraordinary story with a lot of fantasy. Just a story with humans, somewhat realistic.

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

We went to Antwerp to see Dua Lipa. It was quite a ride since the Dutch railways were striking and the bus was late and everything, but we got there on time and also came back on time. Dua Lipa was very good live and I was actually impressed. I'm not sure why, but I didn't expect it. Something nice about her is that she always sings a song from the country where she's performing at! She even spoke a bit of Dutch!

June was the month were we went *back* to the cinema, where we watched three movies: *Materialists*, *The Phoenician Scheme*, and *The Balconettes*. They were all very good in their own way, but if I had to recommend a single one, I'd actually recommend *Materialists*.

When it comes to TV Shows, we finished the first season of *Your Friends & Neighbors‚Äù*, *Adults*, *A Man on the Inside* and *The Buccaneers*. I'm not really feeling like going a lot into the TV shows. They were nice, and entertaining.

Happy July, enjoy the sun, and wear sunscreen ‚òÄÔ∏è!
