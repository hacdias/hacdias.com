*The Ministry of Time* is the debut novel from Kaliane Bradley. It is set in a world where the British ministry has started a new initiative to gather "expats" from different points in history in order to understand if time travel is feasible.

The book follows the story of these "expats" from the past and their bridges - the people who are supposed to help them adapt to the twenty-first century. There are some twists and turns in this romantic science fiction novel. It was a very engaging read for me and just made me want to keep reading until the end.

Towards the end, there were a few revelations that I wasn't expecting to see. Furthermore, I didn't expect the ending at all, and it made me feel many different emotions in just a few pages. It was slightly frustrating but, in the end, also heartwarming.
