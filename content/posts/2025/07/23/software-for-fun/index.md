Time and time again, I have come across articles about [writing "useless" software](https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/), or [programming as play](https://austinhenley.com/blog/programmingasplay.html). These sort of articles always wake up something in me. They focus on programming as a fun, playful thing, instead of making things with a hard purpose.

They remind me of the time I made a few¬†experiments¬†for fun. I should do that kind of programming again: fun programming. I have some of those linked in my [more](/more/#shoebox) page. And it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be web programming either. Just fun, with fun things.

Here's a list of some of these things I have come across that are just fun:

- [üñ±Ô∏è Pointer Pointer](https://pointerpointer.com) is a website that shows a picture pointing to the place where your cursor is pointing at. I'm not even sure how they do it, but it's just fantastic.
- [üîä Wave Share](https://ggerganov.github.io/wave-share) is a serverless, peer-to-peer, local file sharing through sound using WebRTC. The "sound" part is what makes it quite fun. Try it out!
- [ü§ñ WinGPT](https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/) is an AI assistant for Windows 3.1. That's quite an old thing. When building such things for such ancient software you also come across problems, like how to [implement TLS/SSL](https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/tls.html) on a 16-bit Windows.
- [üìÅ AT Protocol Repository Browser](https://repoview.edavis.dev/) is a... well... browser for an AT Protocol repository. You can navigate through your own "profile" and see all the "files", just as if it were a directory on your computer.
- [üß∏ DNS Toys](https://www.dns.toys/) lists some arguably useful tools using DNS. When are you going to need to roll a dice using `dig`? Well, it is possible. It is fun.

Maybe I should do stuff like this, just for fun. I think I get in my head very easily on having to do things with a very specific purpose that need to be useful for other people.
