Now that the last year has ended, I can finally collect all the data from the different services, and start my yearly analysis. This year, we're starting with the "Year in Popcorn". In contrary to [last year](/2024/01/05/year-in-popcorn/), I brought back the plots by reusing both the data from my website for the movies, and the data from Trakt for the series.

## üèÅ First and Last

The data is a bit fuzzy, because I only track episodes on Trakt, and sometimes I forget and have to add it retroactively. So it's likely that dates don't match perfectly. But the data for the films is trustworthy. It seems that the first thing I watched in 2024 was **Mean Girls**. And the last one was an episode of **Shrinking**. Looking back, I think this data is correct.

## üé¨ Movies

According to my [watches](/watches/) page, I watched **54** different movies during 2024. That's more than double of what I've watched in 2023. A reason that could explain this is the fact that I have a Cineville subscription, allowing me to go to the cinema every time I want. I think this was the main drive to watch (indie) films that I would otherwise not have watched.

It seems that I watched the most films on Fridays or in the weekend, which would make sense, since that's when it's easier to go to the cinema for me. It's also interesting to see that in June and July I barely watched any movies. I have no idea why, but it's interesting to see.

## üì∫ Shows

It seems that during 2024, I watched episodes from **40** different shows (1 less show). The show I watched the most was **Dertigers** with 128 episodes watched. That's quite a lot, but the episodes were also very short at around 20 minutes each. It's a Dutch series that follows a fictitious group of friends that are around 30 years old.

The second most watched series was **Abbot Elementary** and then **The Bear**, with 48 and 28 episodes, respectively. These were also series with relatively short episodes, but less seasons, which explains the big discrepancy in comparison with the most watched series.

Looking at the data, I see that August was the month where we watched the most episodes, reaching almost 140. That'd make sense since that's when we watched the most **Dertigers**. In addition, Wednesday and Thursdays seem to be the days of the week where we end up watching series. I don't know why. For some reason I expected Tuesday and Sunday.

I want to take this data with a grain of salt üßÇ: sometimes I forget to track a certain episode on Trakt and then I no longer know which was the right day. So it's possible that the weekday plot does not reflect 100% my series watching habits.

I'm happy I just put a bit more effort into this post this year in order to generate the plots for both the movies and the series. It was a nice year overal, and I'm happy with the movies I watched. Having a cinema subscription means I end up watching movies that I would otherwise not want to pay for, and sometimes they end up being really good, especially considering that I mostly go to indie-like cinemas.
