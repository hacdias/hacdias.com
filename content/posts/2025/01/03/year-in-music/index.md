Similarly to [previous¬†years](/2024/01/03/year-in-music/), it's time to share my musical habits throughout 2024. Around a month ago, I published my [Spotify Wrapped üéÅ](/2024/12/06/spotify-wrapped/), but, as usual, I don't trust it completely. If they're sharing it before the end of the year, how can it successfully show the statistics for the whole year? Here I am again, with my (almost) complete data from Last.fm.

## üìä Statistics {#statistics}

Just like in previous years, let's start with some quick statistics: in 2024, I scrobbled **17 491** times, with an average of **48** scrobbles per day. In total, I listened to **40 days, 15 hours** of music. I listed to the most music on Mondays, and peaked on early afternoon. That's quite similar to last year.

According to Last.fm, I've listened to less music than in the previous year. This was also the case last year, and I still think that the reason I mentioned last year is still what explains it: we've got a vinyl player, and we listen quite a lot on it. And I usually don't track those. Also, my partner sometimes plays music on his Spotify at home, so that doesn't get tracked for me either.

My top artists list changed a bit this year, but not in the sense that there were new artists. The change mostly regards the order of the artists on said list. In any case, my top 10 includes 4 Dutch-speaking artists: Merol, Bente, Lola Ced√®s and Froukje. If we look further, there's even more.

The other positions are occupied by artists that have consistently been in my top most listened artists in the past years, including Marina and Lady Gaga. Marina had been the first in previous years, and it seems like she's back.

It comes at no surprise that the albums I've listened to the most last year belong to my top artists. At first place, we have *Love + Fear*, a 2019 album by Marina, which I've come more and more back to. In the top 10 albums, there's 4 Dutch albums.

I would like to highlight *Naar De Haaien & Weer Terug*, which I've most listened to after I went to Merol's concert a few months ago. I'm actually surprised it is in the top, since I went to the concert in November. I guess that means I enjoyed it quite a lot.

## üéµ Songs {#songs}

As usual, looking at the songs is not that interesting for me, but it's a nice data point to have. I haven't listened to a single song 100 or more times this year. The most listened song has 99 scrobbles and then it just goes down from there. In truth, I've probably listened to said songs more times, but because I didn't track vinyls or concerts, the data is not 100% accurate.

## üé´ Concerts {#concerts}

This past year, I "only" went to four concerts: a classical concert in Vienna and three Dutch artists: Merol, Eefje de Visser, and S10. We had some other concerts planned, but, due to unforeseen circumstances, it was not possible to attend all of them unfortunately. On the positive side, we managed to always sell the tickets üéüÔ∏è.

Overall, it was a nice "musical year" üéµ, and it seems that my musical taste is quite stable over the past years. And the presence of Dutch music too! In general, I keep hovering around the pop genre. Let's see what 2025 will bring!
