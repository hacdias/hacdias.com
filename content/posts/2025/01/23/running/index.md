A few months ago, I [hinted](/2024/09/02/recently/) at the fact that I wanted to try out going for a run. And even though I didn't share more about it, I did it. Back in September, I decided to try going for an interval running session. However, I had absolutely no running equipment at the time, so I just put on some gym clothes and my sneakers, and went.

The day after, I had so many sore muscles, from my feet to my abdominals. I was definitely not expecting to get so many sore muscles, especially from such a short session. Fast forward a few months, and after not getting any response from my [swimming lessons](/2024/09/09/fear-of-deep-water/) enrollment, I decided to give the C25K program a try.

The [C25K](https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/), or Couch to 5K, is a program designed to build up one's running skills to go from nothing, to be able to run about 5 kilometers within 30 minutes in 9 weeks. Each week there's three runs. It seemed like a fine idea. However, considering all the Achilles problems I had the two years ago, I decided to check out with a physiotherapist, just to get a professional opinion.

After telling the physiotherapist how my Achilles has been doing - I still feel things sometimes, but it's not often -, and the sort of exercises I sometimes do in the gym, such as box jumps, he said it should be fine, as long as I follow a plan that builds up strength slowly. And to not do too much at once!

So… that same week I went to Runners World and bought my first running shoes, some very comfortable shoes actually. I also ordered a few new shirts and pants from Decathlon because the only things I had were shorts… and it's cold now. Additionally, I bought some long compression socks as per the physiotherapist's advice. Since it's cold, I also got a ridiculous beanie and a neck warmer.

Last week, I did the first week of the program, and everything went seemingly fine. I actually had absolutely no sore muscles after, which leads me to think that the problem in September was actually my shoes. Those shoes were probably very not appropriate for what I was doing. Or I'm just stronger now, or both.

It's now the second week, and I completed today this week's second workout. After the first day this week, I got some soreness in my right Achilles, but it went away during the same day. Today, in addition to my pre-workout stretch routine, I also did a post-workout stretching and I don't feel anything thus far.

It's been fun, and I hope I can reach the end of the programme without many issues. I do have some trips planned here and there, so it's likely that'll repeat a week or two of the programme, or go easier on a specific week accordingly.

One thing that I notice is that many people listen to music or podcasts while running. I decided to do it without, since I never do it when I go for a walk alone. I like to be aware of my surroundings, and listen to the sounds.

Funnily enough, the swimming pool has now sent an e-mail to say that the days I had selected are no longer available. Since I just started this running plan, I don't want to go add more things in the mix. Maybe later this year, I'll reevaluate and apply again for the swimming lessons.
