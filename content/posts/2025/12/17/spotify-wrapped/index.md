Yesterday, after publishing my year recap of [train rides](/2025/12/16/viaduct-wrapped/), I suddenly realized I had forgotten to post something here that I have been posting the [past years](/tags/spotify-wrapped/): my Spotify Wrapped 🎁. So, here it is. This year, it didn't come much as surprise, maybe because because my top artists usually shift a bit, but the big picture remains the same.

Spotify came up with some AI reports this year, focusing on specific days of the year and the behavior of those days. I found them interesting enough, so here's my New Year's day, my most diverse day, the day I listened to the most music, and the day I repeated the most songs.

In a few weeks, I will make my [own recap](/tags/year-in-music/) with all the data from Last.fm, meaning it will also include the month of December. Sometimes it makes the top artists and songs vary quite a bit, so I'm curious to see whether Spotify's algorithm is accurate this year.

How was your musical year?
