This year, I discovered [viaduct](https://viaduct.world) , a service to track train rides. Since then, I've [been tracking](/2025/07/19/tracking-train-rides/) my train rides and I've imported most of the train rides I could remember or had some registry of. They now came up with a "wrapped" of this year and it's quite nice to look at!

<!--more-->

One thing to note is that each connecting train counts as a "trip". So if I were to go from Eindhoven to Zwolle and change in Utrecht, it'd count two different trips. Nevertheless, I did quite a lot of kilometers on rail: more than 13 000! And this is not counting all the metros and train-like services I took in Japan.

In two weeks, they will be updating the wrapped to include the remaining trips of the year, so the statistics will actually show the whole of 2025! I will update this post then with the updated statistics. I don't expect much to change since I'll probably only be going one time to the office.

One goal for 2026 is to maybe get to around 75% coverage in The Netherlands. It should be possible, I just need to visit Friesland and ride a few regional lines there. There's also quite a lot of tracks in North Holland which I've never ridden.
