*Arroz Doce* is a Portuguese rice pudding and it is one of my favorite desserts, which I make time to time. As it turns out, many other countries have similar versions of this rice pudding, so I'm not really sure where it originated. What I can say is: Portuguese probably eat the most rice among Europeans.

Back in 2023, I tried to make this dessert for the first time on my own, but I didn't use the [right rice](/2023/01/28/when-the-rice-isnt-right/) and it didn't end up as nice as I expected. I'm yet to find the right rice alternative in the Netherlands, so for now, my recommendation is to find a Portuguese or Brazilian shop where you live and see if they have "arroz carolino".

Last [december](/2024/12/31/recently/), I made this dessert for a work event and it was a hit. So, when I had the opportunity to cook something this year, I decided to go for the true and tried dessert, but now with a twist: it had to be vegan 🌱. It turned out fantastic, I can barely notice a difference between the non-vegan and the vegan version. Maybe if I were to compre them side-by-side, but that's not going to happen very easily.

## Ingredients

- **200 g** of Carolino rice
- **250 g** of sugar
- **30 g** butter (🌱 plant-based margarine)
- **1 L** of whole milk (🌱 barista almond milk)
- **4** egg yolks (🌱 skip the eggs)
- **1 tsp** of salt
- Lemon peel
- Cinnamon stick
- Cinnamon powder

## Preparation

1. Cook the rice in a 1:3 proportion of rice to water, along with the lemon peel, the butter (🌱 plant-based margarine), the cinnamon stick and the salt. Cook until there's almost no water.
2. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for around 20 minutes.
3. On medium heat, add the whole milk (🌱 barista almond milk) gradually to the rice and continuously stir, as if it were a risotto. The milk should be warm before adding it to the rice.
4. When it's well cooked and creamy, add the sugar and stir well. 
5. If using eggs: turn the heat to low for 1 or 2 minutes and add the eggs. Stir very well.
6. Pour into serving dishes and garnish with cinnamon.

For the vegan version, as mentioned above, I would just skip the eggs instead of finding an alternative for them. The eggs are there mostly for the colour and a bit of flavour. Some people also make the non-vegan version without eggs, so you're not missing on much. I think another key thing is to use a barista milk, which contains much more fat, which helps the rice become creamier.

Enjoy 🍚!
