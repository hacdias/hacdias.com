When I started drinking more milk-based coffee beverages, I used to always be in awe when I got a cup with latte art on it. So it won't come as any surprise that since I [purchased](/2024/01/06/current-espresso-setup/) my first espresso machine, I have been attempting at doing it myself. I must say: the journey has not been the easiest.

At the beginning of the journey, I struggled just pouring the simplest heart. And I must say: it still doesn't work out exactly as I expect every single time. Nevertheless, I have been attempting at becoming better at it.

I think the main reason it was so hard was related to my milk steaming skills. These have improved a lot since I got the [new machine](/2025/07/09/current-espresso-setup/). The steaming wand on this new machine is much more powerful, meaning that there's much less time, and therefore margin for error, when steaming the milk. So I guess I just adapted, and the results have improved lately.

Recently, I've been focusing a bit more on tulips, and I'm reasonably pleased on how they've been turning out. However, I definitely need to work on the reproducibility. There's something wrong with my technique. I think I'm pouring too close to the edge of the cup, while I should actually be "pushing" the milk.

Latte art is not only a part of the ritual of preparing a coffee drink, but also a way of imbuing a bit of personality into it. And I want to become better at it. There's a coffee roaster here in Eindhoven where they give latte art workshops. I might do it for my birthday ☕️.
