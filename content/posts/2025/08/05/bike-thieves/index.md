Last year, I [shared](/2024/04/01/bike-thieves/) that someone tried stealing my e-bike and that they later managed to damage the battery. Yet, they did not steal anything. Well, I've now got a much juicier story: my normal bike has been stolen while parked at the central station's new bike parking.

It almost feels like a rite of passage: getting a bike stolen in the Netherlands. There are memes about it, stories about it, statistics about it, but you never expect it to happen to yourself.

On the 28th of August, a regular Monday, I woke up. That day I was going to the office in Utrecht, so I had to go get the train. I stepped outside, called the lift, went to the bike garage, unlocked my bike, and biked mindlessly to the station.

When arriving, I contemplated trying to decide on whether to park the bike. You see, they are now building a *temporary* bike parking on the north side of the station, because the south side is under construction. Around half of this new, *temporary*, bike parking is already available.

Somehow it is already full at 8 hours in the morning, so I just put my bike in one that was of a bit more hard access, or so I thought. Went to Utrecht. Fast forward a working day, I was back in Eindhoven. I went back to the bike rack where I had left my bike. It was nowhere to be seen.

In addition, I noticed that there were only a few bikes. Not only was my bike missing, but probably dozens others. The lower bike rack was almost empty, while the other ones were still buzzing with bikes. I thought I might've forgotten where I actual put the bike, so I went around and checked the rest.

I couldn't find it. Went back home with the bus, and decided to check again the day after, in the case that I actual had misplaced it. No, I didn't. It was indeed gone. I very quickly made an *aangifte* online at the police. The day after I got the police report, which I could now deliver to my insurance.

Yes, I do have bike insurance, for both the normal and the e-bike. Considering the price of the bike and the price of the insurance and for how long I've had it, it just spared me a bit more than 500â‚¬. Nice!

I went to the bike shop, through which I did my insurance, showed the police report, they did the formalities and ordered a new bike. I decided to just get the same bike, but the gray version, which I think is a bit uglier.

But the color won't be a good enough deterrent for bike thieves. And the stickers I had on the old one neither. I am thinking about spray painting it with spots of pink. A very ugly gray cow with pink spots. Is that unique enough to make sure no one wants to steal the bike?
