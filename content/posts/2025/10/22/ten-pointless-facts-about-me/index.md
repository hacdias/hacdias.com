A few days ago I read [Kev's post](https://kevquirk.com/blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/) on ten pointless facts about him, and just now I saw [Manuel's](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/10-pointless-facts-about-me) come by. Considering today's my birthday, I thought it would be fun to join the challenge and also share 10 pointless facts about myself.

<!--more-->

#### Do you floss your teeth?

Yes, I floss my teeth every day.

#### Tea, coffee, or water?

I usually start my day with a flat white prepared with my [espresso machine](/2025/07/09/current-espresso-setup/). Later on in the day, I might drink another ([filter](/2024/01/04/current-filter-coffee-setup/)) coffee, or go more into the teas. In general, I also try to stay well hydrated and drink water the whole day.

#### Footwear preference?

I'm not sure if I have strong preferences in terms of shoes. Inside, I walk with just socks on, so... no shoes. Outside, I mostly wear sneakers, but I've recently got some zero-drop shoes which I've been trying to get used to.

#### Favorite dessert?

I really enjoy [*Arroz Doce üçö*](2023/01/28/when-the-rice-isnt-right/), which is a Portuguese rice pudding. It's probably one of my favorites, but there's many others: Bolo de Bolacha, Pastel de Nata, etc.

#### The first thing you do when you wake up?

Get up and go to the toilet and wash my face.

#### Age you'd like to stick at?

I just turned 26, so it's hard to say. I would say now, but who knows.

#### How many hats do you own?

Let me go count them... *80 years later*. I seem to have 8 hats and a few beanies. The important part is that I don't wear most of them. I got them at some point at some event, and stuck to them. I mostly switch between two hats.

#### Describe the last photo you took?

This morning I took a photo of the latte art on the flat white I made. I was a bit proud of it.

#### Worst TV show?

Can't say. Probably just wiped out of my memory.

#### As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I wanted to "do something with computers". And look, now I'm working as a software engineer, so I think that one worked out okay.
