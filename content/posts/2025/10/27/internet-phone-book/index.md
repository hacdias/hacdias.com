A few weeks ago, I received my copy of the [Internet Phone Book](https://internetphonebook.net/), which I've briefly [mentioned](/2025/07/22/discover-blogs/) on this website before. The Internet Phone Book includes a list of over 700 websites that you can dial in via their website, as well as essays about different topics.

Some months ago, I learned about the existence of this book through a [post](https://bsky.app/profile/kevin.woblick.com/post/3lqjdsheq7227) on Bluesky. That was back in June. At the time, I thought it was such a nice idea and I wanted to buy it. Unfortunately, it was sold out everywhere, so I signed up for the newsletter.

When I got the e-mail notifying me it was back in stock, I did not hesitate and ordered it. It's the first edition of the book, and I thought it'd also make a very nice table book, a way of initiating conversations and let others know a bit more of this personal web that exists.

Since it arrived a few weeks ago, it has been sitting in the tables in front of the sofa. I've leafed through the book multiple times and visited a few websites - always nice surprises! But last weekend, it was my birthday, and I thought: I'm going to keep it here in the middle of the table - and a few others - and see if people notice it.

They did! Some people were very intrigued by the bright yellow book on the table called "Internet Phone Book", so they also leafed through it, asked questions, etc. In the meantime, I've also read through the introduction and the "how to use this book" section.

I had not expected this book to have been built as a website, but now that I know it, it makes sense. I can't imagine all the struggles to stylize properly so that the print version would look as good as it does! Congratulations to the team.

If a second issue ends up happening, I will try to not forget submitting my website! I really enjoy this sort of projects, and I hope a second edition ends up happening at some point. It does show that the web can still be personal, custom and fun.
