      "content": "March is almost gone and here we are again, at one more recap of what has happened over the last month. Compared to February, March has been a pretty eventless month, at least on the surface.✍️ WebsiteVery little has happened on this website since last month. I had many articles - and still do - in my drafts, but haven’t had the time, or want, to get back to them. However, I wrote an article about the time I “hacked” my high school’s library computers.Writing that article reminded me that I have always been somewhat interested in security, but never did much about it. At my bachelor’s university there was a security club and I almost decided to join. Sadly, I didn’t. Now, I decided to join TryHackMe. I hope I can learn a few nice things, mostly related to networking.🍄 LifeAs I stated previously, it was a very eventless month. I went to physiotherapy once, I joined a gym - yey - where I am now getting some 1:1 guidance. I decided to do this mostly because of my foot, to help my recovery. I’m much better than before, but there is still a long way before it feels 100%. With this, I also want to become stronger and just more active. Sadly, it’s hard for me to keep this kind of habits. Having someone telling me what to do at a specific day and time is perfect. Maybe in the future I’ll be able to understand more how everything works and be able to decide by myself which exercises to do.At home, we hang some shelves, bought some more plants and we’re now thinking about the balcony. The weather 🌞 is becoming slightly nicer so it’d be great to have at least some form of sitting in the balcony. I also printed some pictures and hanged them. I think I will want to share that in a separate post though.🍿 WatchingWe watched “The Witcher: Blood Origin” and the first season of “The Last of Us”. Both interesting, in different ways. I must confess that “The Last of Us” made me feel a bit uncomfortable and scared due to the topic, but I’ll definitely watch season two.🎮 GamingWell, I finished the main story of “Hogwarts Legacy”, but haven’t played much this much in general. I would like to fully complete the game, but I’ve been pretty busy with work and some other things, such as trying to learn Dutch and other online courses.That was it, March is almost gone! I hope you had a great March and wish you the best April! 😊",
