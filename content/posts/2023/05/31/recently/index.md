May is now approaching its end and the birds 🕊️ are chirping, filling the air
with spring noises. Summer is almost there. There have been quite a few nice things
to look back in this month. Let's go.

## ✍️ Website {#website}

During this last month, I made a few updates to my website. Arguably the most
noticeable is the homepage update. Before, I was simply listing the latest
dozen posts. Now, I just show the last posts (articles, readings, photos),
as well as some favorite posts and the latest six photo articles. Some other
minor changes have happened, but I leave that to you.

## 🍄 Life {#life}

In the beginning of the month, I visited the 🚆 Spoorwegmuseum in Utrecht. It was
an incredible experience and I wrote an [article](/2023/05/06/visit-to-the-spoorwegmuseum/)
about it where I shared some of the pictures I took, as well as the overall experience.

Two other high points of this month were my trips to both Zeeland and Giethoorn.
Just like last year, Zeeland was a bit cold, especially in the sea, but it was nice.
Giethoorn was a very nice place. We did a day trip there and got a boat tour
by a local that volunteers. The weather ☀️ was nice and I definitely recommend.

## 📚 Reading {#reading}

In the reading department, I started and finished ["The Culture Map"](/2023/05/21/the-culture-map/).
I wrote a review about it, so I'm not going to talk more about it here. In addition,
I received a copy of "The Creative Programmer" from [Wouter Groeneveld](https://brainbaking.com/).
He kindly gave away a few copies, and I was one of the lucky ones to receive one.
I'm almost half-way the book and it's been positively interesting. Once I finish,
I will write a review.

## 🍿 Entertainment {#entertainment}

Regarding movies, I watched the "Bullet Train". It was quite a nice movie. In the series
department, I finished quite a few. But I want to shout out to "Queen Charlotte" and
"The Empress". "Queen Charlotte" is a fictional series which gives more background on
Queen Charlotte from Bridgerton. And "The Empress" is based on the real-life story
of Empress Elizabeth "Sisi" of Austria.

Last week, I went for a live concert of Pieter de Graaf, a Dutch neoclassical composer.
The concert was in Tivoli, in Utrecht. It lasted a bit over one hour and it was very interesting.
I've never actually heard much from him, but my partner was interested in going, so we did.
I'm glad I did and I recommend you to try listening a bit to him.

Have a nice June!
