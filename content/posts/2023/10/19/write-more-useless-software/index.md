Found this post today on HN, and came across this post today about writing what the author calls "useless" software. I certainly "vibed" with the post and its [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37911900) on HN. I think that since I started working full time, I haven't done anything much fun programming-wise outside of work. Not counting my website, but that is what it is.
