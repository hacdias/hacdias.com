Three simple pictures I took during a walk in the Stratumse Heide. It's already starting
to look somewhat like autumn, which I appreciate. I also haven't used my camera for quite
some time, so I'm very happy I brought it with me. I went there hoping to see highlander cows.
Sadly, I didn't see them this time, but I saw some of their... manure ðŸ’©.

There were some things I did not photograph because a thunderstorm was becoming closer and closer.
Therefore, we thought it'd be safer to start leaving.
