I was mindlessly navigating the socials and I saw someone posted an article that caught my attention: [Shields Down](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/). This article dives deep into the fact that "happy people don't leave jobs they love", or, more specifically, what led them to be in a "shields down" mode:

> Your shields drop the moment you let a glimpse of a potential different future into your mind. It seems like a unconsidered off-the-cuff thought sans consequence, but the thought opens you to possibilities that did not exist the moment before the thought existed.

Once your shields are down, you're more prone to look into other opportunities, and more prone to also accept them. The same author had also written [Bored People Quit](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/), which covers a lot of reasons why someone's shields go down, being one of the most important reasons *boredom*.

I highly enjoyed reading these two articles, and I do think it is a valuable read for everyone, but especially for managers. Maybe the reason why I enjoyed them so much is because I'm feeling some resonance.
