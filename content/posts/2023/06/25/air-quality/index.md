It seems that Apple Weather doesn’t use the same scale for air quality in all countries. While I’ve been seeing air qualified as bad day after day, the Germans, for example, see it as good air quality. I don’t think this helps us, as people, and citizens of our countries. Apple should either let us choose which scale we want to see, or be clear about this behaviour.
