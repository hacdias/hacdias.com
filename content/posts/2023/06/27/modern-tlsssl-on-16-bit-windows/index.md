This is from the same author that implemented [WinGPT](https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/) for Windows 3.1. In this article, they go over the notes on how they implemented TLS/SSL on a 16-bit Windows. It's quite interesting, even though I have never programmed this low level on such an older machine. Also haven't used Windows in quite some time, so it's always nice to see.
