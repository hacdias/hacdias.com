The author of this article had published two videos on Twitter where he showed an old Windows 3.1 and a new Windows 11 machines opening the same apps (command line, explorer, notepad). In this videos, Windows 3.1 was the fastest, which leads us to think: has any progress been made?

In this article, the author goes in more detail about what happened and why it happens. I do agree with the conclusion that the lack of focus and prioritisation on _performance_ is likely the main reason why our OSes and applications have a lot of latency nowadays.
