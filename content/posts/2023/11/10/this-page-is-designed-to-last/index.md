Very interesting post on how to make long lasting web pages. The 7 most important points are:

1. Return to vanilla HTML/CSS
2. Don't minimize HTML
3. Prefer one long page over several
4. Do not hotlink
5. Stick with native fonts
6. Compress, compress, compress (images)!
7. Eliminate broken URL risk
