![Popcorn](https://cdn.hacdias.com/media/2021-02-popcorn.gif?class=right+pixelated+pyip22) A few years ago, I published an article where I did a small [analysis](/2020/02/22/trakt-analysis) of my Trakt data, which contains the shows and movies I have watched. I decided to bring that back again under the name "Year in Popcorn". I considered "Year in Movies & Shows" but I thought that was too long and unappealing 😅.

In 2022, I am aware I watched many things, especially TV shows. To say the truth, I feel like I probably watched too many TV shows during the year. However, some of them I also watched on the background while doing something else. Besides, most of the year I was still studying, which made this much easier. Now that I'm working full time, I'm sure the amount of TV shows I watch, or at least the cadence, will decrease.

## 🏁 First and Last

The first thing I watched in 2022 was Episode 2 of Season 2 of **Travelers**, on the 1st of January at 11:22 in the morning; while the last thing I watched was Episode 10 of Season 3 of **Emily in Paris**, on the 30th of December at 22:00 in the evening.

## 🎬 Movies

During 2022, I watched **45** different movies, having repeated none, except for "Everything Everywhere All At Once", which I watched two times, in different occasions with different people. My top 3 movie genres are Comedy, Romance and Drama.

Then, I decided it would be a great idea to see my movie watching habits in two different perspectives: by weekday, and by month. We can see that, when it comes to weekday, I'm more likely to watch a movie on the weekend when compared to a weekday, especially on Saturday.

</div>

Regarding months of the year, I can see that the most prolific months are December and January, which, historically, has been when I have a break from University. In addition, every time I go to my parents house in Portugal, we watch a movie together every night, which also contributes to the spike in December.

## 📺 Shows

During 2022, I watched episodes from **59** different shows. The show I watched the most was **Workin' Moms** with 80 episodes watched. Naturally, the show with the higher number of episodes would be the most watched. My top 3 TV show genres are Drama, Fantasy and Science-Fiction. Drama seems to overlap with movies, too. But the remaining ones not that much!

  <summary><strong>Top Shows Genres</strong></summary>

  | Genre           | Count | Percentage |

  | Drama           |    37 |       22.2 |
  | Fantasy         |    24 |       14.4 |
  | Science-Fiction |    24 |       14.4 |
  | Comedy          |    16 |        9.6 |
  | Mystery         |    13 |        7.8 |

  | Soap            |     1 |        0.6 |
  | Crime           |     1 |        0.6 |

Similarly to what I did for the movies, I also plotted how many episodes I've watched per weekday and per month. Similarly to the movies, there are more episodes being watched on the weekend. However, there is not a large difference between Saturday and Sunday.

</div>

When it comes to watching patterns per month, I can't see any specific pattern. I did watch a lot of episodes every month, so there doesn't seem to be a specific pattern.

Well, this was my 2022 in movies and TV shows, which I called "Year in Popcorn". I am curious for how this statistics will look like next year. Will I have watched less shows, or maintained? Will the ratio between shows and movies be different? Who knows!
