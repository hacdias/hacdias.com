January, the infamous first month of the year, is reaching an end. It was a very eventful month, but, by this time, I feel like I say that for every month that passes. I am honestly hoping that February will be a slightly more boring month in that sense.

## ✍️ Website

During January, I did not made large changes to this website. In general, they were rather small even though they may seem large. In addition to fixing some bugs, as usual, I also removed by checkins 📍 and itineraries 🗺️. I decided to do so as I felt like they did not add much to the website.

Finally, I made my [Trips 🚆](/trips) page better. I think it displays the trips in a better way and it is slightly inspired by [Tim's](https://timharek.no/) logs. I still want to backup my Swarm checkins and I still have to write a script to do so. I will probably try Deno 🦖, as I have been slightly curious about it for a while!

## 🍄 Life

In terms of life events, not a lot happened, but I went to Switzerland for a small company trip. It was quite nice to see some of my coworkers again and enjoy some time with them. Besides, I went there by train which was quite an [interesting experience](/2023/02/26/a-deutsche-bahn-tale-on-ice).

I took quite some pictures, but I have yet to go over them. However, I leave you one here, one of my favourites. I have been thinking about printing some of my [photos 📸](/photos) and framing them to use as decoration in the entrance hall and living room of my apartment. I think that could turn out nicely.

## 📚 Reading

Around two weeks ago I finished reading "Sweet Bean Paste", yet another Japanese book added to my collection. I don't know how to describe it, but it's a sweet book with a very fascinating story about friendship and love. There's no science fiction, there's no technology. Just plain people and a story to it.

## 🍿 Watching

I watched M3GAN in the cinema. M3GAN is this mix of science fiction and horror movie. I usually don't enjoy horror movies, but this one was quite interesting. I think the main problem of most horror movies is that they're only about jump scared. But if there's a psychological element attached to it, it becomes much more interesting.

## 🎮 Gaming

This is the first time I am including this section. I have acquired a PlayStation 5, as well as "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Matters". I have always been a big fan of Ratchet & Clank, even though I've only had the opportunity of playing one game from it. It brings back memories, but allied to a fantastic story telling and graphics. Recommend it so far!

And that was it! Let's look forward for the next month and see how this year develops. I'm looking forward to start working out more, in hopes that will also help my Achilles tendon, and to the Dutch classes - oops, I haven't said this yet - that I started taking this month!
