I gave a lightening talk ⚡️ at [IPFS þing 2023](https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/) on the 19th of April, about the progress we have made over the past months
on building a website for the InterPlanetary Specifications of the IPFS ecosystem. Here's the [slides deck](https://media.hacdias.com/2023-04-19-interplanetary-specifications.pdf) and the video.

I realize I spoke a bit too fast. It was supposed to be a lightening talk, but not necessarily a lightening² talk.
