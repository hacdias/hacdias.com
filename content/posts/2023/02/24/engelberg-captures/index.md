Last month I had the opportunity of visiting Engelberg, in Switzerland. During this small trip, I spent some quality time with my coworkers and took some pictures. Below are my favourites. I had to include two trains, because... why not?

.fg-2023-02-24-engelberg-captures {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "a b c"
    "d d d"
}

.fg-2023-02-24-engelberg-captures > *:nth-child(1) { grid-area: a; }
.fg-2023-02-24-engelberg-captures > *:nth-child(2) { grid-area: b; }
.fg-2023-02-24-engelberg-captures > *:nth-child(3) { grid-area: c; }
