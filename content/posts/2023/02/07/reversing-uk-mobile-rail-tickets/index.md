This is quite an interesting article. The author goes over the process of reverse-engineering the contents encoded in the Aztec code of the UK mobile rail tickets, which, of course, does not follow the European standard. In addition, eta also published [a tool](https://eta.st/tickets/) where you can scan your UK tickets and see their contents. Now it would be very interesting to read something similar with the European standard and, of course, a similar tool. Maybe that's an idea for a post.
