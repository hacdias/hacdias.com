The maximum temperature today - which means now - is around 24C and clear skies ‚òÄÔ∏è. I just got the not so unexpected urge to write something about biking. I say unexpected because I am back from a 40km ride from Eindhoven, to Oirschot, through Middelbeers and back.

Yesterday I picked up my e-bike, which is [finally repaired](/2024/04/01/bike-thieves/). From now on, I am keeping the battery at home. Anyways, that is not what I want to talk about, even though I don't have that much to talk about. I just want to say that biking with nice weather for long distances is amazing.

Every single time that I do a somewhat longer bike ride I feel energized and... just... happy. For me it's a sort of unique feeling that I get from this type of bike rides. Sometimes I feel like I want to just record the whole thing to be able to see it back. I never take that many photos.

Everything is so green, so lively. It is spring. Yes, 24C is definitely too much for this time of the year in The Netherlands. I'm a bit  cautious about the temperatures that are coming until the end of the summer.

We stopped a few times. One time to drink the iced coffee ‚òïÔ∏è that we had pre-made. The other time at a *friet* üçü place from which you could see the airplanes, since it was very close to the airport. They also had ice cream üç®, which we definitely tried.

But for now, enjoy, go out and take a ride üö≤!
