July is coming to an end and the sun is shining. This was a month with quite some events for me, both on the good side of the spectrum, as well as on the bad side of the spectrum. But mostly good. Let's dive into it!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Website {#website}

July marked the [tenth anniversary](/2024/07/12/a-decade-of-blogging/) of this website! Coincidentally, I have made a few more updates to this website this last month in comparison to the previous months. I made a few changes here and there, including adding a little bit more of interactivity. I made this changes such that they wouldn't be very noticeable, but more so of an ü•ö easter egg sort of thing.

## üçÑ Life {#life}

As I've already shared, I had my last Dutch classes at the beginning of the month, and I have [no plans](/2024/07/04/taking-an-indefinite-break-from-dutch-classes/) of taking more courses anytime soon. In addition, I finally got the results to the Dutch State exams for Dutch as a second language, and I passed. My Dutch is [officially](/2024/07/23/dutch-b2/) at a B2 level, which means I am allowed to do a university degree in Dutch. It's crazy to think about it considering I moved to the Netherlands less than 4 years ago!

I volunteered for the first time to this organization called [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/). They help specific groups of people, such as refugees, with learning software development, mostly web development. My task as a mentor volunteer was to check homework and give continuous feedback during 2 or 3 weeks. I have already enrolled for two other times, so let's see how the next ones go.

[Martin](https://mew.tv/) came visit, which was quite nice! We went to the [RoboCup](https://2024.robocup.org/), which happened to be this year in Eindhoven, and Martin knew some people there because he used to be part of the team! That allowed me to get a closer look at the robots competing! We did other things, such as visiting the [Next Nature Museum](https://nextnature.museum/en), and a few bike rides. It was an enjoyable time!

I'm now in Portugal visiting my family. It's crazy to think that the last time I've been here was in December last year. Time flies quite fast, and vacation days are not unlimited, so it's hard to juggle all the things in the limited time left.

## üí™ Health {#health}

Almost everything going well, but I'm quite bummed out: I've somehow injured my wrist and it's been two weeks and it still hurts doing quite a lot of things. It's better though, I think, I don't even know. I will visit the doctor soon, so let's hope we can figure out how to fix it, and, more importantly, prevention. Not the first time I have wrist pain, but it almost never got this bad. I guess my job won't make it better long time unfortunately. It doesn't hurt typing though, so that's good at least.

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

We watched *Inside Out 2* on the cinema and it was quite nice. Despite being an animation movie, I think it has a good message behind it, this one especially. Feelings are complicated and it's sometimes hard to be open and to be able to talk about them.

On the series department, we have watched quite a few things. We watched *Loot*, both seasons, just because we didn't have anything else to watch. It was ridiculous: it's one of those series to watch in the background while you actually do something else. We then watched *It's a Sin*, marking. Later, the ridiculous *Exploding Kittens* series based on the card game. Extremely ridiculous. Comical. And finally, *Dear Child*, a somewhat psychologically dark German series. Recommend.

Have a nice August!
