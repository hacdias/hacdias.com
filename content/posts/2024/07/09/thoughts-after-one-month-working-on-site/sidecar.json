Take the experience and learn from it. ðŸ˜Š For me, it was the other way around. I had my apprenticeship on-site until Covid-19 forced it to be remote. But in 2022 they started with a mandatory day per week on-site. So I searched for other options and found a job where I had more flexibility. This flexibility then allowed to move together with my girlfriend, and I think that was a perfect decision. ðŸ˜„ But I also understand everyone preferring an office when they don\u0026#39;t have an optimal work environment at home or like it more to be at a place with other people.",
