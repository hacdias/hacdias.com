Today is the 12th of July. For most people, this date doesn't say much, but it marks the anniversary of this website, counting from the first ever blog post I wrote here. And... that was ten years ago, in 2014. Yes, gentle reader, this website is now officially a decade old!

Ten years ago, the then fourteen year old Henrique decided to create a blog and wrote his [first blog post](/2014/07/12/apresentacao/). Reading it back, it is cringe, but I will let it keep living on this website. It is always nice to see how I have changed and how I have evolved. Funnily enough, I said I wanted to be Software Engineer on that post 10 years ago. And look at where I am now!

This website has also suffered many visual changes over the years. Some time ago I wrote two blog posts where I documented all the designs of this website from [before](/2022/03/25/my-website-before-indieweb/) and [after](/2022/06/18/my-website-after-indieweb/) IndieWeb. Even the domain was not always the same. In the beginning it was plainly `henriquedias.com`, which in the meanwhile just redirects to the current domain at `hacdias.com`.

I wonder how it will look like in 10 years, or if I will still have this website. I hope so, if it is possible, of course. It feels like a milestone, a rewarding milestone. I have learned a lot and met a lot of people virtually through this website. If you're someone that doesn't have a personal website, I would definitely [recommend](/2020/10/26/why-have-your-website/) you to!

Maybe I should get a small cake - or something else sweet - to celebrate today. In the meanwhile, I wish this website a happy ðŸŽ‚ cake day! And thanks to everyone I have met along the way, and thank you for reading.
