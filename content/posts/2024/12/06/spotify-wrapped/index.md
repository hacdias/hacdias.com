It's that time of the year again, and Spotify Wrapped is back. Just like I did [last year](/2023/11/30/spotify-wrapped/), and the [year before](/2023/01/02/year-in-music/#spotify-wrapped), I decided to share the "results" from one year of listening to music here. As usual, I will do a better analysis at the beginning of next year with all the data from Last.fm.

Just like last year, and probably all the other years, my Spotify Wrapped üéÅ came with some surprises that I was expecting. This time, my phone is no longer in Dutch, but the prevalence of Dutch artists continues to be a highlight:

When it comes to top songs üé∂, it seems that 22 from *MEAU* (and not from Taylor Swift) was right on top. I have listened to it around 100 times this year. That's quite crazy to think about. Then, it is immediately followed by a song from my boyfriend, just like the last one on the list. So he got two songs on my top 5.

My top artists üé§ was not totally unexpected. I was actually a bit surprised to see MARINA in the top again, considering she hasn't released new music in quite a while. However, we know it's coming soon. Then, the rest of the ranking is full of Dutch-speaking artists, and Lady Gaga. Compared to last year, only MARINA and Froukje survived the ranking.

Then, we also have Spotify's way of showing how my musical listening habits "evolved" over the year, but I will let you just look at the images. It's always a bit ridiculous, but I'm fine with it. As usual, I'm curious to see how this will compare with the actual data I will get from Last.fm.

How was your Spotify Wrapped this year?
