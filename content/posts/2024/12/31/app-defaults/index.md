In the course of 2025, I hope to further reduce the Google services from this list, especially when it comes to documents and cloud file storage. To be fair, I don't really use it that much, only for maintaining one or two spreadsheets, and I rarely make slides or written documents. Moving these to local files would be ideal, but it is also undeniable that the versatility of Google Docs makes it very compelling to use.

Keep an eye on my [uses](/uses/#software) for an always up to date version of this list!
