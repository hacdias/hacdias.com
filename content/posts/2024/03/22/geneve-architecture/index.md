<style>
.fg-2024-03-22-geneve-architecture {
  grid-template-areas:
    "a b"
    "c c";
}

.fg-2024-03-22-geneve-architecture> *:nth-child(1) { grid-area: a; }
.fg-2024-03-22-geneve-architecture> *:nth-child(2) { grid-area: b; }
.fg-2024-03-22-geneve-architecture> *:nth-child(3) { grid-area: c; }
</style>

Finally, we also visited Genève. The weather was definitely better and we could enjoy the sun. We ended up in a district whose architecture was quite striking. So I decided to share 3 pictures.
