I have been using the same two [NuPhy](https://nuphy.com/) keyboards for almost two years, and I've also been wanting to write something about them for quite some time. Why not just do it?

Back in 2022, I wanted to replace my higher profile Ducky One 2 Mini keyboard by something with a lighter and lower profile. Back then, I was also working at a coworking space, and I had noticed the switches I had on that keyboard were a tiny bit too loud.

I think the main reasons at the time were that a lower profile keyboard would be a bit more comfortable to type on that the Ducky One 2 Mini, especially without a wrist rest, which I do have now anyways.

So after quite a lot of research, I ended up purchasing the NuPhy Air75 with Gateron Red switches, as well as their own wrist rest. This is a reasonably low profile and low sized keyboard. It doesn't have a keypad and I thought it was nice looking and comfortable to type on. I still do.

A few months later, I decided to buy one of these to replace whatever we had in our home desk office. I don't remember exactly what we had there, but maybe it was just an Apple Magic Keyboard.

So after a bit of research, I ended up purchasing the Air96 also with red switches. The difference here is that this one includes the numpad. Not because I wanted, but Chris works quite frequently from home and he uses the numpad quite often in comparison to me.

Some months later I ended up buying a fancy cable from [CableMod](https://cablemod.com/) for the keyboard at home, to match the aesthetics. Not very important, but it looks good with the keyboard and the rest of the desk.

A fun thing about both of these keyboards is that they work with bluetooth, but I almost never use them wireless. Sometimes I realize they are wireless and think: "oh, wow, I've never noticed this", even though I know back there in my mind that I knew it very well.

I have a reason to do it at home, though: everything is connected to a dock, which is then just connected with whatever laptop is being used at the moment. And it works.

Anyways, it's been almost two years since I have both of these keyboards and they still work well and I never had problems with them. In my opinion, they look great and are comfortable to type on. From all the keyboards I have owned before, these are my favorite ones. So I'll give them a solid 4.5 out of 5.
