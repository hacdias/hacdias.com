January was a very busy month, which I did not really expect. More importantly, it's already *gone*. One twelfth of the year has already passed. How crazy is that? Let's quickly dive into the latest events.

## ✍️ Website {#website}

January was somewhat of a prolific month when it came to writing articles, especially the first half. I wrote a whopping record of 13 articles in such a short amount of time. I don't think I've ever published so many articles in such short amount of time. Nevertheless, that seems to have stopped. My favorite post to write this past month was ["When Does Abroad Stop Feeling Like Abroad?"](/2024/01/10/when-does-abroad-stop-being-abroad/).

During January I've also created a [digital shoebox](/2024/01/13/making-a-digital-shoebox/), where I also added new content that I didn't use to have online. I am happy I did it. It's a nice place to throw some things that I want to publish, but have no clear place of where they should go. In other news, I also added an "archive" view to my [photos](/photos/) and graphics pages.

## 🍄 Life {#life}

I started my new Dutch course, for level B1-. I have classes twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 12:00 and 14:00. The timing is far from ideal, as it kind of cuts through the middle of the day. I'm lucky I can take this classes, but for the next course I will try the 9:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I will likely write more about classes and my "Dutch-learning" plan in another post.

I have met with quite a few people during different occasions during this month. I have also joined a Homebrew Website Club Europe call for the first time. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to join any other events, as I'm either too tired or I have something else already planned.

I also had to visit Den Haag in order to visit the Portuguese consulate to renew my ID card. It expired in the middle of January, but I didn't want to schedule an appointment too soon since the government kept saying the new standardized ([EU law](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/1157/oj)) ID cards would be launched until the end of 2023. Nothing has happened, and we're still issuing non-standardized ID cards.

In the middle of December I then decided to make an appointment, which is usually fine: issuing a new ID-card usually takes 5 working days abroad if I pay the urgent fee. Unfortunately, the earliest appointment was a week after my ID card expired. It seems to already be available to pick up from today, but they're only open for pick-ups between 14:00 and 16:00 and I really can't go today as I have important meetings.

## 💪 Health {#health}

I started going to the gym three times a week in January: Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It's been great so far. There's not a lot I want to say here, but I'm now doing more cardio-related exercises and functional strength training too. Before it was mostly traditional strength training with weights and stuff.

## 📚 Reading {#reading}

I finally finished reading *Harry Potter en de Steen der Wijzen*. It took longer than I wanted, but that's my fault as I'm not giving it enough time to read the book. I also started *Harry Potter en de Geheime Kamer*, which I already have over 50% read.

## 🍿 Entertainment {#entertainment}

When it comes to movies, I went to the cinema two times this month. I watched both *Wonka* and the new *Mean Girls* movie in the cinema. Both were good, in their own ways. I had to also watch the older *Mean Girls* movie at home, since I had never watched it before.

In the series department, I want to give a shout out to *The OA*, which was one of the first Netflix original series. I had never watched it before, but it captivated my interest. I think it's very nicely made, and it's sad it ended up being canceled after the second season. Also watched the second season of *New Heights*, which I recommend.

The most unexpected event this month was going to a theater, in Dutch. I went yesterday to Breda to see the production of *COCK* by *Theater Oostpool*. I certainly did not understand all the jokes and everything that was said. However, I followed the main story line - and also understood *some* jokes. I think it was a great experience.

Looking forward for February. There are quite a few things I have planned.
