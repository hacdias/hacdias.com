February is complete. That means that around 16% of the year is also gone. Many things happened this month - I feel like I say this every month though. Let's take a look at everything that happened, from some trips, to my Dutch language course ending.

## üçÑ Life {#life}

In the beginning of the month, I went to FOSDEM with Sebastiaan, where I also ended up meeting Thor. I have already written about [surviving FOSDEM](/2024/02/05/fosdem/). I recommend taking a look at that post if you want to know more about my FOSDEM experience.

Towards the end of the month, my partner and I went together to Vienna, with the [night train](/2024/02/27/traveling-to-vienna-with-the-nightjet/). It was quite an interesting experience, which I've already talked about in the linked post. Both Vienna and Bratislava positively surprised me. I don't really know what I was expected, but everything looked orderly, clean, and beautiful. The weather was also great ‚òÄÔ∏è.

I have also finished the Dutch course that I had started in January. This was an intensive B1- course with lessons two times per week. Everything went great I would say, and I'm excited to start the next one, next month. This time, however, I'm choosing a slightly better time slot: instead of having classes in the middle of the day, I'll have them in the morning.

## üí™ Health {#health}

Not much to say here, despite the fact that I am keeping going to the gym three times a week. I only did not honour this in the week I went to FOSDEM - went two times to the gym -, and the week I went to Vienna - went 1 time. 

During our trip to Vienna, and Bratislava, we walked quite a lot. On a certain day, we walked over 17 km. Considering my Achilles injury that took a very long time to heal, I am happy I did not have more complaints. On the other hand, I've felt a few - very few - "sensations" that I hoped I didn't. I hope resting on the next days is enough.

## üìö Reading {#reading}

On the book department, I concluded reading the Dutch version of *Harry Potter en de Geheime Kamer*. I have not, however, begun with the third book. I hope I will start it next month.

In the meanwhile, I also started reading an easier adaption of *Het diner*, a quite famous Dutch book. This book was gifted to nme by Sebastiaan a few years ago for my birthday. I want to start reading a bit more original literature, so I decided to read this before adventuring into something else.

## üçø Entertainment {#entertainment}

This month had a bit more live performances than usual, which means it had two. I went to a comedy show by Derek Mitchell, which some people may know as *Let's Double Dutch*. In addition, I went to a classical concert in a church in Vienna.

The movie, or cinema, department has also grown this month. We got a Cinevillepas, which allows us to go to unlimited times to the cinema in certain, mostly independent, cinemas. I want to especially recommend *Poor Things* and *The Boy and the Heron*.

When it comes to shows, we watched the first season of *Percy Jackson*, *De geheimen van Barslet*, and also the new season of the live action adaption of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. I've heard that some people didn't like it that much. I, personally, found it way better than I expected.

Happy March!
