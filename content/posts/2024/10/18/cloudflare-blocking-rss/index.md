This likely explains why I've had problems with many feeds in the past months. The solution was always to change the `User-Agent` to something else. It is very sad that this is happening to such a large amount of users, and I can see that most non-tech people would not even care at all about RSS.

Personally, I also use Cloudflare and I've considered many times moving away from it. Unfortunately, I haven't done that yet. I don't know if the alternative would be to just use another DNS service, or try to find something more complete for caching purposes, such as Bunny - which I already use for the media.
