I have been having a few problems with some of the feeds on my feed reader during the past months. Changing the `User-Agent` has always fixed the error. Now, I came across this article from Open RSS entitled [Using Cloudflare on your website could be blocking RSS users](https://openrss.org/blog/using-cloudflare-on-your-website-could-be-blocking-rss-users).

This very likely explains all of the issues I have had across the past months. It is very sad that this is happening to such a large amount of users, and I can see that most non-tech people would not even care at all about RSS.

Personally, I also use Cloudflare and I've considered many times moving away from it. Unfortunately, I haven't done that yet. I don't know if the alternative would be to just use another DNS service, or try to find something more complete for caching purposes, such as Bunny - which I already use for the media.
