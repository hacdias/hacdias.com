In July 2017, something unexpected happened: I opened the trending page on the GitHub interface, under the Go language and saw my own project there. [File Browser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) - then still called File Manager -, was trending in first place under the Go language!

At the time, that allowed the project to go from around 200 stars to over 700 during that week. Nowadays, this project I started long ago has over 22k GitHub stars ⭐️. Despite no longer maintaining it, I'm grateful to the current maintainers for continuing the project.
