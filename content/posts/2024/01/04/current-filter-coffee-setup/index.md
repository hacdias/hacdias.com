Doing a quick search on my website yields almost no results for "coffee". And I find it quite strange that I’ve never talked about coffee here, especially during the past two years. During the past two or three years, I went from basically not drinking any coffee to buying filter coffee equipment, to now owning an espresso machine. Today I want to focus on filter coffee.

Since 2022, I have been buying - perhaps too much - coffee equipment. It started with either a Chemex or a French Press. The dates are a bit foggy because I don't have the purchase date of the French Press. Not too long after I bought a Clever Dripper too. In 2023, I decided to also purchase an AeroPress.

With all these purchases, you may ask yourself: do you even use all these gadgets? Oddly enough, I think I do. Certainly, I don't use my Chemex as often as my Clever Dripper. However, I do definitely use both of them, in different ways, for different purposes. At the moment, this is my preferred choice:

- 🏆 **Clever Dripper** for single cups. If I am making coffee for just myself, or for myself and one more person, I will almost always default to the Clever Dripper: it is easy and... clever.
- 🧊 **French Press** for preparing cold brew. I rarely do regular immersion French Press coffee nowadays. I prefer the taste of cleaner coffees. But it is very used during summer for preparing cold brews.
- 👥 **Chemex** for preparing for multiple people. If there's more than two people that want filter coffee, I will most likely use my Chemex for it. I'm not sure how much it can prepare at once, but I do know for a fact that I've never fully filled it.
- ✈️ **AeroPress** for travel. It is small and compact enough that I can bring it with myself. This I use mostly if I go visit my parents, or some other longer period vacation.

Regarding coffee recipes and preparation, the mostly come from James Hoffman's incredible [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) as well as his [book](https://tenshundredsthousands.com/collections/books/products/how-to-make-the-best-coffee-at-home). I also want to highlight Morgan Eckroth's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@morgandrinkscoffee), which I also follow for more espresso-based drinks, which I may mention in the next article that I speak about coffee.

Regarding coffee beans 🫘, which are probably the most important piece, I have tried from quite a few places. For now, we've settled with [Wakuli's](https://www.wakuli.com/) Discover Monthly light roast subscription. I like the idea of experimenting something new every month, and it is quite nice for filter coffee.

Something I'm looking for to adding to my setup is a pouring kettle. Since I use the Clever Dripper the most, the pouring kettle isn't the most important addition, so I've been pushing it off from time to time. If you have a recommendation, feel free to share.

I hope that you enjoyed this post. I also updated my uses page to include a section [about coffee](/uses/#coffee). For now, it only includes filter coffee related material. Once I release the espresso post, I shall update it and include a "coffee station" photo.
