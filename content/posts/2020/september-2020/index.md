Today's the first day of a new month, so here's a new "recently" post. Since I decided to start this series after [mid-september](/2020/09/21/recently), there's not that many news since. However, I'm more than happy to write a few words about what's been happening lately.

First of all, I decided to create a ~newsletter~ even though all posts I will send through it will be available on my website since day 1. Then, why did I choose to create a newsletter? I always wanted to publish articles regularly, but sometimes it's difficult to keep going when we don't feel obligation for it. After talking to [Alfonso](https://twitter.com/adlrocha), I decided to give it a try.

## Darkroom

Regarding photography I have two updates. The first one is related to this website. I decided to give my photography its own beautiful page instead of just a tag (remember #lifethroughlenses?). From now on, you can visit my photography in the [darkroom](/photos). It's obviously not a darkroom, but I thought it would be a great name for that page.

Over the years I have had many photos pages on this website but always ended up removing them in order to simplify the website. However, I'm in that point where I no longer think that "less is more" regarding this website. Not saying more is better though! I don't want to solely relay on Instagram for my photography and this way I have flexibility over its presentation.

The second update is as simple as this: I decided to join the Eindhoven Film and Photography association. It's called [Dekate Mousa](http://dekatemousa.nl/) and there's activities all Tuesdays at night related to either photography or film.

## Thesis?

Since I'm already in the first year of my Master's degree, which is just two years, I have been reading, investigating and thinking a lot more what's going to happen next year: the project/thesis. I should pick an area and a specific topic soon and try to contact a professor regarding this. Or just see what the professors at my uni are looking for, but that might not be as exciting. Next Monday I will be bringing a post specifically about this. So... if you're curious, please wait for it!
