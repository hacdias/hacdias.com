I see the possibility of a global library where information is curated for accuracy, where everyone has access to learn, where everyone is equal. Maybe blockchain is a solution, more power to you. Another alternative I would like to see is community servers - run like local libraries where content is provided and paid for by its members, a more democratic process less likely to be corrupted by the likes of BIG business.",
