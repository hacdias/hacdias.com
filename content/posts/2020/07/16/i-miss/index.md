Last night before going to sleep... well actually while falling asleep I thought about writing this. It's such a basic poem, but lemme just share it here.

> **I miss**
> 
> I miss their hugs<br>
I miss my hand on their hair<br>
I miss their hand on my hair<br>
I miss they holding my hands<br>
I miss holding their hands<br>
I miss their face<br>
I miss their shape<br>
I miss their skin<br>
I miss them<br>
I miss physical<br>
I don't miss coronavirus.
