Hello, world!

This is how I start my first newsletter: the same way I started programming. If you're receiving this on your mail inbox, that means you probably know me. Anyway, I'm Henrique Dias, a 16 years old student who loves music and programming stuff.

First things first: why are you creating a newsletter? There are some basic reasons for that:

+ I want to write more and I found out that this could be an interesting way to do so.
+ This way I can be more connected with you.
+ It's different.
+ It's funny.

And why calling it **Stuff I'm Thinking**? Hmm... well... the truth is it was one of the first things that come to my mind that didn't sound too bad. And, anyway, it's acronym is amazing: SIT - not that wonderful-amazing-beautiful-thing, I know. But... just SIT around and relax reading this.

Right now, I'm not really sure about the frequency, but it will start being monthly, in the first weekend of each month, or twice a month. It's going to contain whatever I remember to put on it: images, quotes, posts, stupid stuff?
