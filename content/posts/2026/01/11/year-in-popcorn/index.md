Now that the last year has ended, I can finally collect all the data from the different services. This year, we started with the "Year in Music", now followed by the "Year in Popcorn". It's a bit shorter than [last year's](/2025/01/01/year-in-popcorn/) due to some fuzzy data, but let's quickly recap.

## 🎬 Movies

According to my [watches](/watches/) page, I watched **32** different movies during 2025. That's 22 less than the year before. Despite still having a Cineville subscription, we ended up going less often to the cinema. Nevertheless, many of these movies were at the cinema, so that makes me happy!

The first movie I watched was *Nosferatu*, and the last one *The Instigators*. We went from watching the most movies on Fridays to Sundays, not sure why. April and May were quite busy months with travel, moving apartments and new jobs, so that could explain why we did not watch a single movie for two months!

## 📺 Shows

During 2025, I watched episodes from **51** different shows, which is 11 more than last year. The show I watched the most was *Ghosts* with 50 episodes watched. When it comes to firsts and lasts, we started the year watching *Dwars door de Lage Landen*, and ended with *Percy Jackson and the Olympians*.

This year I'm not plotting how many episodes I watched per weekday or per month. Last year, I had already mentioned the data was quite fuzzy because I don't track it religiously every time I watch. This year, I'm very conscious that happened quite a lot, so it'd be very distorted.

I wish I had put more effort tracking the watched episodes the day I watch them. After all, I literally just need to press a button. With music, however, it's automatic. Something I'm also trying to do this year is watch less series, and we've already canceled some services - we subscribed to way too many! Maybe that will make us watch more movies instead.
