The year has just begun, which means, similarly to [previous years](/2025/01/03/year-in-music/), it's time to share my musical habits throughout 2025. Around a month ago, I published my [Spotify Wrapped 🎁](/2025/12/17/spotify-wrapped/), but I like to make my own analysis since Spotify releases their own way before the year ends. Let's take a look!

## 📊 Statistics {#statistics}

Starting with some quick statistics: in 2025, I scrobbled **19 222** times, with an average of **53** scrobbles per day. In total, I listened to **44 days, 11 hours** of music. I listed to the most music on Wednesdays, and peaked in the morning, which is different from last year. I think this reflects going to the office on Wednesdays, which means I listen to more music in the train.

</div>

I have listened to **9.90%** more music than the previous year. A reason for this could be the fact that I go to the office and the commute takes quite a while. Not sure if that's enough to make such a difference, but it definitely played out a role.

## 🎤 Artists {#artists}

The top 10 artists changed quite a bit, and more than half of the artists got lower positions. Marina is still my top 1 artists, while Lady Gaga moved up a position. Most of the other artists (re)entered my top 10. In comparison to the previous year, there's a lot less Dutch artists, only Merol survived this top list. I'm sure all other artists are still in the top 50, they just didn't make my top 10.

Just as always, it comes as no surprise that the top albums I've listened to belong to the top artists. Lady Gaga appears to be the top 1 with *MAYHEM*, but that is deceiving, since both the non-deluxe and deluxe versions of *Princess of Power* are the top 2 and top 4. Summing their scrobbles makes that album top 1. I really enjoyed that album, as well as *MAYHEM*. Also a shout out to *West End Girl*, *LUX* and *How To Let Go*.

## 🎵 Songs {#songs}

As usual, looking at the songs is not that interesting for me, but it’s a nice data point to have. For completion, you know? Just like last year, I didn't listen to a single song more 100 or more times, and, funny enough, the top 1 song has 99 scrobbles, just like last year. But, repeating what I also said last year: I’ve probably listened to said songs more times, because it doesn't include vinyls or concerts.

## 🎫 Concerts {#concerts}

This past year, I went to nine concerts: that's five more than the year before. And not only that, but many of this were quite big artists, such as Lorde, Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa. I really enjoyed all the concerts I went to, but I think Lady Gaga's MAYHEM Ball takes the win.

One thing that's missing is tracking the vinyls we listen to. I have a system in place to track our vinyl library and the vinyls we listen to, but it's very incomplete and not ideal. I'm hoping to, at some point, automate it so that when I listen to a vinyl, it gets scrobbled to Last.fm.

Concluding, it was a very good "musical year" 🎵 and I think my musical taste didn't change that much. We already have some concerts planned for this year, and I couldn't be more excited!
