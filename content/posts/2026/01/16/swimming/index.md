It feels good to be back in a swimming pool. After a lot of hiccups in the process of starting the swimming lessons, I finally had my first one last week, and yesterday my second one. It's been quite a blast.

Around year and a half ago, I [wrote](/2024/09/09/fear-of-deep-water/) about my fear of deep water, or rather, my lack of knowledge on how to get around a swimming pool when there's no way to stand. I can *swim*, I can *float*, but I can't thread the water.

With that being said, I wanted to start going often to the swimming pool, but they're all deep, so I decided to enroll the lessons instead. That took so long. The first time they called me some 6 months afterwards to tell me the *time and day* I had chosen were not available and to pick a different time.

At the time I had just begun running and I decided to just cancel. That meant getting out of the waiting list - which apparently are quite long. I knew I'd have to wait again, but I really didn't want to add more things to my schedule again.

A few months ago, I decided to register again, at both swimming pool complexes in Eindhoven in the hopes that that'd be faster. Well, at the end of December I received an e-mail. Unfortunately I couldn't start that week, so I had to wait until after the Christmas school break, since they work with the same schedules.

So last week I had my lesson, and it was very nice. As I mentioned before, I've learned how to swim, but only front and back crawl. All other important things were left out. So it's good to see I can still do those things more than 15 years after.

Knowing that - and seeing me do things -, they changed me to the second level. I'm now busy learning how to do the breaststroke, at least the legs. It's very different from crawl and feels a bit unnatural. For on the back I think I've got the hang of it, but now I need to improve the "regular" one.

Looking forward for the next lessons! I'll probably also visit the swimming pool one more time in some of the weeks to get some practice.
