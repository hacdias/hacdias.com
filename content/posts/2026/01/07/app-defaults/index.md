It seems that I forgot to write an "App Defaults" in the course of the whole 2025. Towards the end, I started seeing this sort of articles pop up in my feed reader again, and I wanted to write one, but I forgot. Now that Robb Knight's [article](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults-2026/) popped up, I decided it was time do it. Not a lot has changed:

I started using a self-hosted instance of Linkding again, prompted by [the changes](/2025/07/31/recently/) I made to this website. I realized that maintaining the list of bookmarks the way I was doing was not something I thought made sense anymore. I still share some link occasionally, but then it needs to come with some added information from my side.

My quest to depend less on Google hasn't improved that much. I need to really take time and change all the accounts to my own e-mail address. Most important things are changed, but there's still the occasional account and e-mail coming to Google. Also still depending on Google Sheets for my finances. I'm unsure what's the best alternative without creating an account on yet another service. Let me know if you have a suggestion.

On the course of 2026, I'd like to use Telegram less. Only my parents and a friend group are there. I've moved some people to Signal, and my parents are easy to move to Whatsapp, which I think *is fine*. It's still E2E encrypted, and oddly enough I feel like I trust it slightly more than Telegram nowadays. I get **so much spam** over there, it's insane. The most difficult one will be the friend group.

As always, I will keep my [uses](/uses/#software) page up to date!
