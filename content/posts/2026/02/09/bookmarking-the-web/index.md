Yesterday I [shared](/2026/02/08/atmosphere/) some atmospheric thoughts. One of the ideas was seeing which services do I use now that could be replaced. One of those is bookmarking. There's two main contenders: [Margin](https://margin.at) and [Semble](https://semble.so/).

<!--more-->

I currently self-host a Linkding instance for bookmarking and it works well and it's simple: a bookmark is a link. Optionally, I can add a markdown note and tags. Linkding also has a nice integration with Web Archive, so all the things get archived the moment I bookmark them.

Margin and Semble could both be used as replacements. And they're [interoperable](https://notes.cosmik.network/3me2iifnwic2x), which is amazing. After trying both a bit, I have some questions and I'm just a bit confused. So I thought: why not write them down? Maybe I'll get some answers.

Let's start with Margin:

- Has an awesome browser extension. Makes it effortless to use. It's also very cool to be able to see what other people have annotated on a specific web page.
- A bookmark / annotation / highlight can both have tags, and be in a collection. I don't understand the difference, or which one I should use. Both would work for categorizing, but what makes them different?
- I have the feeling that the bookmark / annotation / highlight could be merged. A highlight feels like an annotation of a piece of text with a color and no note. An annotation is a note with maybe a colorless highlight. A bookmark is just a link, with no note or highlight. Another thing is: I want to be able to see all of them in the same page, which I haven't found a way to yet.

And Semble:

- The discoverability of the "Similar" and "Mentions" features are amazing. I love it.
- There's just collections, no tags as far as I can see. So that issue is sort of solved. However, I'd like to be able to create new collections easily while creating a new card.
- There's more friction to create a card. Yes, there is a bookmarklet, but it feels like it takes a while to load and I think a browser extension would work better for me.

I really like the idea of both, and they both have their strengths. Semble feels simpler in terms of types of objects: there's a card and a collection. That's it. Margin has the power of annotating the web. However, I feel like the three different types of items make it a bit more complicated than I'd like. I think if I could see them all in a single page, it'd already be a big improvement. Just an "All" tab in the Profile page. And then go over to Semble for discovery!

When it comes to the Web Archive integration of Linkding, that I can solve on my own with a custom schema and take care of it myself if I end up moving the bookmarks to either one of these places.

I'd love to hear your thoughts!
