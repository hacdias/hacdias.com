This is an unusual post: today I did not finish a book, but I decided to consciously stop reading it.
And yet, I give it a 3 stars out of 5, which, for me, doesn't mean it's bad. It means it is good,
but it is still lacking something for me.

Last month, a friend of mine showed me the video below that accompanies the song "bachelorette"
by bj√∂rk, and I was immediately interested. The video follows this cyclic nature that was captivating to me.
Having then shared this video with another friend, I was recommended "If on a Winter's Night a Traveller".

I ordered the book, whose edition was releasing the next day I had been suggested to read it,
thinking it was a sign that I must read it. I read around half and I must say that I understand
why it is considered a masterpiece and why it can be very nice.

Without spoiling, I was definitely captivated by the story of *The Reader*. On the other hand,
it was quite tiring to read the stories that *The Reader* was reading. So much that I considered
skipping them, but then I would be skipping half of the book. In the end, I just decided to stop.
Stop, and focus on other things I want to focus at the moment.

I have always tried to read a book from beginning to end. And maybe that's where this book
also gives me some issues: it is a book full of beginnings, but no ends. And beginnings of books
I would likely not read at all, which does not make it easy to focus.

So, for now, I give it a 3 out of 5. I understand why it can be very good, but it did not
cut it for me at this moment in time. Maybe I will come back to it at some point in the future?
And then manage to read the whole book? Who knows?
