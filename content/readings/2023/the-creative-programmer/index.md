Last night I thought: tomorrow morning I will finish reading *The Creative Programmer*,
and so I did. I woke up this morning, had a light breakfast, made a coffee, and sat
down in the balcony reading the last pages of Wouter's book.

Last month, [Wouter](https://brainbaking.com/) made a giveaway on different platforms where
he offered a copy of his most recent book, *The Creative Programmer*. I was one of the
lucky ones that received one of the copies. The title was quite enticing. However,
the book was different than what I expected... in a positive way!

I expected the book to be more technical, which it wasn't. There's no reason why this
book had to be technical. I think perhaps the word "programmer" led by brain to put
it into a "extremely technical" book box. It is more about the process, about the psychology,
about *what makes a creative programmer*.

During the different chapters, Wouter introduces different aspects that, together, and 
relating to each other, make a *Creative Programmer*: from critical thinking, to curiosity,
communication and constraints. Towards the end, everything is connected.

The book is very readable, has many examples and counter examples, many puns, and it is
overall just a fun and enticing experience. Additionally, it also includes many exercises
that the reader can do to reflect and/or exercise their creativity - shamefully I didn't do
all of them, but I will certainly go back.

I am, of course, not going to deep dive into the book here - that's why *the book* exists.
I do highly recommend it for everyone that programs, either as part of their daily job,
or just for fun!
