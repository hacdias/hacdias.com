This book was quite interesting. Similarly to the books I've been reading recently, there's a magical element that makes this book be completely different from what I expected. In a nutshell, there's a man called Wallace that is definitely not a good person. One day, he dies. However, the story tells us what happens after he dies. Of course, I don't want to write spoilers.

I really enjoyed this book and the character development. I listened to most of the book via an audiobook and I think that improved the experience in the sense that I now associate different characters with different voices.
