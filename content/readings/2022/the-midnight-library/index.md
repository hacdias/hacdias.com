"The Midnight Library" portrays a character, Nora, that after dying at exactly midnight, got transported to a library where time doesn't change. In this library, Nora has the opportunity to try all the different lives she would have had if she had made different decisions. To keep the level of spoilers to a minimum, I will not go over a lot more.

This book has been recommended by many people and it has a pretty good rating on GoodReads with 4 out of 5 stars. On the other hand, I've also read and heard negative comments about it. When it comes to me, however, I have mixed feelings, on both sides of the spectrum.

On one hand, I really enjoyed the concept and the writing style. On the other hand, I feel like flicking through so many lives and the way the mental health situation was addressed might've not been the best in the sense that it could be a trigger, instead of a helper. Nevertheless, this is just _my_ opinion. I'm sure and I hope this book has helped countless others.

Overall it was a nice book with a very interesting concept. Yet, not my favorite.

Tot ziens!

Today I “read” part of the book by listening to its audiobook version while cooking and doing the dishes and I must say that I enjoyed the experience. It’s a bit annoying afterwards to find where I am in the actual book but I leverage the fact that this book has short “chapters“. 

Anyways, I’m enjoying the book slightly more now. I still think it’s probably not the type of book I’d have picked up if it wouldn’t have been so recommended. When I get to the end, I’ll share my feelings more in depth. Maybe they’ll change!

This book has been slightly different than I expected. Maybe I didn’t have time to dive deep into it. Tonight I’ll reserve an hour or two to read a bit more.
