Just finished reading "Before the coffee gets cold" by Toshikazu Kawaguchi. It is, yet again, a book that falls into the magical realism domain. In this book, the story takes place in a little café in Tokyo. In this café, there is a special seat where people can seat and travel in time.

Traveling in time comes with many rules. Among them, you must drink the coffee before it gets cold and nothing will ever change. The book follows a few characters that end up traveling and the story behind it and their reasons.

It is a very intriguing, yet fascinating concept that the author brings us. It was quite an enjoyable read and I'm [hoping to read](/2022/03/02/tales-from-the-cafe) the second volume sometime soon.

**Update: 24 January 2022**

So far, really enjoying the concept of the book: it takes place in a coffee shop in Tokyo where, if you sit at a certain place, you can talk to some person in the past... before the coffee gets cold. There's a bunch of rules, but more and more I enjoy this magical realism books.
