Just finished reading the romance "Red, White and Royal Blue" from Casey McQuiston. In this book, Casey creates an hypothetical situation where the First Son of the US and the Prince of the UK would fall in love with each other, as well as the political and diplomatic outcomes from that.

It is quite an interesting read and I was very curious because I've never read that many books with any LGBTQ representation. It was also oddly interesting how most of the story revolved around the First Son's mom campaign to re-election and how the whole situation developed around that.

It was fast paced and one of those books I felt like I wanted to read until the end as fast as I could because I was curious. Well... I enjoyed it.

**Update: 27 January 2022**

So far, slightly different than what I was expecting. However, Iâ€™m enjoying it pretty much.
