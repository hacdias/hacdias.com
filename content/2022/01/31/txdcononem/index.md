  content: I’ve been thinking about replacing Miniflux with Aperture + Monocle. I
    like the idea of using a Microsub client so that I can quickly reply, like or
    react to any post. The problem is that, unfortunately, aperture insists on not
    fetching posts for two of the websites I follow… I either write my own Microsub
    server, or go back to just Miniflux.Has anyone else encountered this issue with
    Aperture?

There's some issues I've been noticing with Aperture and even with Monocle. I use many different types of posts and some aren't supported by those readers, such as listens or reads. On the other hand, I add additional markup on my JSON and RSS feeds to take those contexts into account. I will keep using Miniflux for now and focus on improving my JSON and RSS feeds as there are some issues here and there.
