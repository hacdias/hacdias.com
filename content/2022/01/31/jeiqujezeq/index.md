  content: I think I prefer ebooks because they are easier to hold while reading and
    easier to carry around. But I'm still very on the fence about this, since a physical
    book just feels nicer. Maybe for fiction I'd prefer physical books

I think separating fiction from non-fiction may be an interesting strategy. I should try reading on an e-reader once to see how I feel. I feel like the ability to easily mark sentences and check the meaning of words can be very helpful.
