Today I got my booster.

I also had my first graduation project related meeting. It's quite nice to finally have some direction. Now I have about three weeks to come up with a good research question within the topic and search what's done.

In the meanwhile, I already surpassed the 100th page of the book I am [reading](/readings). I did not expect to be this fast, considering that this author is quite particular: he doesn't adhere to regular punctuation laws! Only commas and periods, capital letter to indicate speech and very few paragraphs.
