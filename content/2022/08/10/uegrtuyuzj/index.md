I'm trying to "degoogle" and finally got enough courage to give Firefox a real chance. So far, there's only two main things bothering me: 

1. Firefox does not support Touch ID as a 2FA method on macOS. I have many websites configured using Touch ID (as well as the YubiKeys) for 2FA but I can't really use it on FF. There's an open [issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536482) about it, of course, but I imagine it taking years to get fixed.
2. Translation. I don't speak Dutch and, even though I can use extensions to translate, none of them translates a website as seamlessly as Chrome does.
