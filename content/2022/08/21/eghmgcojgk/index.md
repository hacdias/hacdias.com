I've been wanting to self-host my Git repositories for some time now. My problem with it is: collaboration. If I just decide to self-host, it'll be much harder for someone to send a Pull Request, or something of the sorts. GitHub is the _de facto_ of the industry and sadly there is not federation standard for these kind of platforms. I think Gitea is working on federation support, but at the same time I think Gitea wouldn't necessarily fit my wants as it is a primarily multi-user platform.
