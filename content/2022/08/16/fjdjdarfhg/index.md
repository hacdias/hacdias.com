  content: One of the reasons I didn’t add a Listens section earlier was Jekyll was
    taking too much to generate all the pages in my website, adding the scrobbles
    would’ve made it unbearable. So what I started doing was manually filtering through
    the listens and highlighting the best albums, if they’re worth listening to, they
    deserve a post, right? I think to be able to browse your Listens by artist, see
    your top tracks by that artist and then all the albums, would be amazing. But
    if you listen to a lot of music this approach would probably deserve its own website
    I guess. Oh and the deleted post is actually the same post with a correct URL.
    I recently switched to Jan-Lukas’ GoBlog and it seems I hadn’t setup the correct
    URL path for notes.

Maybe this is where my problem is. What is the line that divides what I should put on my website vs. another service / subdomain. Same thing for the [wiki](/2022/08/15/knqyayzprq) and [bookmarks](/2022/08/15/llpalrunje) I guess.
