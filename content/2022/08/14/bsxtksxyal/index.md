  content: "I’ve realized that trying to strictly follow what is on the IndieWeb wiki
    won’t work well for me. Thus, I have to invent and change some things to make
    it work better. The IndieWeb Wiki is a good source of inspiration one could use,
    but I don’t see it as a guideline you need to closely follow. A lot of IndieWeb
    sites are too much like social media for my taste. Why replicate social media
    on your site when you have the freedom to make it better? I was never a fan of
    “post types”, too many restrictions and sometimes hard to choose between them.

Hey! Completely agreed. I think it should be a "reply". I'm planning on removing the likes in long-term because they don't add anything interesting. I would say that bookmarks are... bookmarks - posts or websites you find interesting and you might want to look at them in the future. I think those are useful. Likes and reposts feel a bit more... useless let's say.
