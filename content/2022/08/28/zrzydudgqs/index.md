I've been visiting my parents for the past few days - and it has been very nice - but I always forget how slow their Internet is. I just run a [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net) and got 16.28 Mbps down and... guess... 0.76 Mbps up. Also, we only got 16.28 Mbps down because it's 7am and no one else in the neighborhood is using the Internet. It's usually closer to 8 Mbps.
