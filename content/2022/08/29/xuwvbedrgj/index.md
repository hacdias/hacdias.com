  content: I’ve been visiting my parents for the past few days - and it has been very
    nice - but I always forget how slow their Internet is. I just run a Speedtest
    and got 16.28 Mbps down and… guess… 0.76 Mbps up. Also, we only got 16.28 Mbps
    down because it’s 7am and no one else in the neighborhood is using the Internet.
    It’s usually closer to 8 Mbps.

Just repeated it during the day and got some marvelous 6.86 Mbps down and 0.56 Mbps up ⚡️ It's definitely light speed. The worst part is that the Internet provider has had fiber in the town for _years_ now. But first it was just for companies and now it's just in some streets. We're talking about a very small town (less than 500 people), adding cables wouldn't be that much work.
