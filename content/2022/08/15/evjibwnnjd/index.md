  content: I think there’s value in Likes. For me they’re just a way to let the author
    know I enjoyed their post. In my case they’re not mean to be public so I keep
    them unlisted. Inspired by your Listens I added a similar section on my website,
    but it gets one post per month or whenever I mark a song as “Loved” on my music
    player. As for TV Shows Watches, it might be a good idea to post only about completed
    seasons?

Uh, I like the idea of keeping the likes unlisted. Perhaps that's a great idea. Regarding the listens and watches: I like to collect all the information, and since I have it, why not display it? Besides, the way I'm collecting the listens and watches information right now makes it a bit difficult to work with, so I'm not yet 100% sure how I'm gonna change it.

For the reads, I already updated the pages and what I did is to just have a page per book, and that same page shows all the updates regarding that book. No more posts for started reading, want to read, or just finished reading. I can leverage the post updated date to sort the posts in the reads section.

I could do something similar for the watches page where I would have a post per series and a post per movie. I think that could work nicely. However, the organization for the listens would be harder: is it per artist? per song? per album? I will probably leave these changes for the end, while I deal with the remaining. Do you have any ideas?

Btw, it seems I did not receive a Webmention for the deleted post at `https://kandr3s.co/notes/2022/08/2022-08-15-wlaeo`. I will remove it manually, but if you send a webmention for a deleted post, my website will automatically remove it.
