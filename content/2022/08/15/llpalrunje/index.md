Bookmarks. Yesterday I [mentioned](/2022/08/14/should-every-update-be-a-post) I want to improve the bookmarks section in my website. However, I am also considering on some self-hosted services. I want a simple way to bookmark pages and possibly add notes to them, as well as tags. Do you use any service for this? How do you "solve" this problem?
