Wikis, information and commands. Today I was upgrading the Docker containers in my server and I had to figure out how to fix something because there was a breaking update. For future reference, I added it to some random markdown file I have on my computer with some notes. However, I always forget to check it and end up searching for the same things over and over again. 

In the past, I thought about having a public wiki, but that failed. Maybe because I tried to build it on top of very old notes I had that have no real use for me nowadays. What do you use to keep this types of notes and snippets? I wanted to have something simple that I could access and edit at any time, preferably online. Any ideas?
