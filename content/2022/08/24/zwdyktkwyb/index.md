Yesterday I made a few updates to my website’s header. Now, I brought back some elements that I had before, with a title and the search bar and then the navigation below. I also added this avatar of myself that I was gifted some time ago which “sits” on top of the navigation bar.  What do you think? I personally feel like it looks much better both on computer and on mobile, being much closer to what I want. 

In more internal updates, I added [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) with Markdown and YAML frontmatter support for editing entries. It looks so much better and it’s so much natural to edit posts now.
