Today I started executing the experiments for my thesis project and they take so much time ðŸ˜±. Around 30 to 60 minutes each and I have to run around 20 in total. I really wish I could defend the thesis before September, but it feels unlikely. For that I have to have a very good draft by the end of next month, which is feasible, but unlikely.
