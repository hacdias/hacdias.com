For the past one or two years I have been using [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/)'s premium plan for e-mail forwarding and sending. In the beginning, I had multiple domains configured and I thought it was a great solution, as they also provide an SMTP server. However, with time, I only had one domain configured and it costs me around 9 $ + VAT per _month_. That is a lot for a single domain.

Today I migrated to [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com), which is a Swiss service that for 19 $ per _year_ provides me with all the functionality I did. They provide a very transparent list of [pros and cons](https://www.migadu.com/procon/) of the service they provide and I'm happy with them.

I still rely, mostly, on my Gmail e-mail. I'm hoping to change that.
