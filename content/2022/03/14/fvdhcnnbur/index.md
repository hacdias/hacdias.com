  content: I’ve been unsubscribing from intentional/side effect spam (as I like to
    call it) for months now. It’s almost non-existent now. My transition to Fastmail
    (all my domains, plus wildcards) is also done now. I never open any other email
    client. I can finally just rest. No more moving hosts. No more configuration.
    It just works. I’ve also integrated convenience email discussion links to my posts
    and my RSS feed here on my site. As do many other people like Kev, Michael Harley,
    and Marcel Kapfer. I’m hoping even more people adopt this workflow (you already
    have a guide for WordPress by Kev and myself!), as it’s so easy to just hit a
    link and start writing in seconds. I’m more likely to respond to a post because
    now the barrier to it is so less. No needing to provide context, as it’s already
    all set by the convenience link. No need to fill the To field. Signature is pre-configured.
    Post link is added too for posterity and easy reference. Just write. And a big
    part of “just write” is also I sometimes avoid saying “hi” or “hello,” depending
    on my mood and stress levels. Sorry if that comes across as rude! I’ve had a mindset
    shift where I view emails as something in between traditional mail/letters and
    the modern-day instant messaging platforms. To me, a thread is simply a conversation
    where nobody feels pressured to get back quickly, or judged if they take too long.This
    is probably my favourite aspect. Salutations and signatures are completely optional.
    Tiny signatures are best. Both plain text and HTML is great (at least in 1:1s
    and when used responsibly)! Photo by Brett Jordan on Unsplash. 1

I recently transitioned from [ImprovMX to Migadu](/2022/03/06/ttahqozjog) to lower my costs. However, I'm planning to move everything over from Google (Calendar, Contacts and E-mail). Unfortunately, Migadu doesn't have official support for Calendar and Contacts yet. They say that will be available within two months. However, they've given other similar deadlines over the last year that did not happen.

I have considered Fastmail. It would still be cheaper than ImprovMX, but more expensive than Migadu. But at least I would have access to all the features. However, it is also based in Australia with servers in the USA and there is some controversy about that. I don't know yet. I also considered using my own domain with [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212514) but the three aliases is pretty limiting.

Does anyone else have any recommendations? I'm thinking about just waiting to see if Migadu releases actual support within two months, or just move to Fastmail.
