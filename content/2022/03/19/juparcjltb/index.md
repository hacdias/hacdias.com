In the Netherlands, something equivalent would be 362.40 * 12 = 4348.8 EUR per year and only includes train... And the country is much smaller than Germany. To include metro, bus and trams thorough the country, just throw some 2022.00 EUR more.

- NS Flex Altijd Vrij: 362.40 * 12 = 4348.80 EUR
- NET Subscription (Metro, Bus & Tram): 2022.00 EUR

Total p/ year: 6370.8 EUR
