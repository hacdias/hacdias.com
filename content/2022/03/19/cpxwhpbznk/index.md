  content: "So expensive! \U0001F633 But the BahnCard 100 (2nd class costs 4144â‚¬ per
    year) also doesnâ€™t include every bus/tram, just in selected transport networks.
    And I donâ€™t know how to think about the price in relation to the country size
    (same with Austria). Sure, you can travel much larger distances, but there are
    also more people and you can only travel so much on any day. \U0001F914 I currently
    have a My BahnCard 50 (for young people â€“ 66,90â‚¬ per year), which gives me 50%
    discount on regular train tickets. But tickets are still expensive. I need to
    pay around 70â‚¬ for each direction to visit my family in Southern Germany. And
    then trains are often delayed or have technical problems. Iâ€™m still happy with
    public transport in Germany (in general), but that doesnâ€™t mean that you should
    be satisfied with shortcomings. \U0001F60A"

Those are good points. Dutch people frequently complain about their public transport, but it works very well in general. I have Day Discount subscription for the trains that costs 5.10 EUR a month and gives 40% discount during off-peak hours, weekend and public holidays. Additionally, up to 3 people traveling with me can get 40% discount too (albeit group tickets would be less expensive in this case). And I think that's a pretty good discount, considering the overall train prices and service quality. Even with all this discounts I spent over 90 EUR on public transit last month ðŸ˜‚ Free weekends is 31.60 EUR per month.

Fun fact: Dutch students are entitles to a Student Product where they can choose to travel for free during weekdays or weekend on _any_ public transport carrier in the entire country. Technically, EU students are also entitled but it's a very long process (because they [want to make it difficult](https://www.avantadvocaten.nl/the-right-to-dutch-student-finance-of-eu-students-studying-in-the-netherlands/)), which I started three months ago and still know nothing about it. Also, this is not "free": it's a gift. If you don't finish a degree within 10 years, you have to pay everything back and it's over 300 EUR per month.
