A few days ago I [mentioned](/2022/03/18/rvcvtogxia) that I wanted to ditch my daily Last.fm backup script and instead publish the scrobbles on my website. Well, I did it! Instead of publishing a post per scrobble, I automatically create a post that contains all the scrobbles from that day (~~yesterday example~~). In addition, every month and every year receives its own summary post with top artists, albums and songs, as well as listening clock and listening week plots! Here's ~~last month~~ and ~~last year~~ for example!
