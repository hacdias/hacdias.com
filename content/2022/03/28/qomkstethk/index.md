Today I read a news about [GreenCityTrip](https://greencitytrip.nl), a night train that travels to some European cities. From the Netherlands, you will be able to take a night train to 15 different destinations. It is not a regular train with a regular schedule. Instead, there are different 5-day trips scheduled across the next months that you can book. It seems like a very nice idea though and I'm curious to take one of these trips. I really enjoy trains and I think it's a great alternative to flights, especially night trains for long distance trips.
