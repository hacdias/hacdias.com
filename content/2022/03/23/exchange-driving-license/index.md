A month ago I went to the municipality to exchange my Portuguese driving license by a Dutch one. The reasons were mostly by ease of use and that it would come handy in some situations. The thing is that here they take your original driving license during the whole process. Usually, this process takes about 2 to 4 weeks. Since I haven't received anything until today, I called.

The RDW (authority that takes care of this things here) told me they couldn't validate my license using the EU online system and that they contacted the Portuguese entity for validation. Of course, they haven't received any information yet. I talked to other people from EU and it took only 2 weeks. I guess it was because the online system was working with their country. Let's see how much longer this will take...
