Today I made some visual updates to my website. I replaced the spatial background by a plain colour background and merged the header and navigation bar into one. However, I still kept some pages with a custom background because it looks great for some specific occasions.

In addition, I also cleaned up the display of some micro posts, such that they take less space while conveying the same information and looking equally as good. There are still some things I want to change, such as Webmentions and forms and buttons. I will, however, defer that for a later time.
