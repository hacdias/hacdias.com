I've been using [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) as my e-mail client since I got into Apple devices. Spark is an Ukrainian app and recently my university's opsec team reached out saying that, even though I have permission to use the app - because I had asked for it -, it may be removed due to the current conflicts in Odessa. I think it just happened because I can't use it anymore. I moved back to the native Mail app on my devices. The ironic part of this all is that my university's opsec team recommended Gmail as an alternative. Yes, Gmail.
