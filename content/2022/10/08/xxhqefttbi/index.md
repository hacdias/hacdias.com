I installed, for the first time, a window manager on my mac. It's called [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) and it basically just brings all the simple snap to resize functionality I used to love on Windows. It's nothing fancy, but it's free and open-source and it seems to work quite well so far. Highly recommend this app if you're looking for something similar. If you use macOS, and you have some kind of window manager, let me know. I'm curious to hear more experiences!
