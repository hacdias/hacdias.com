It seems like Tailscale just introduced [SSH over Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-ssh/) which is quite interesting. Even though I haven't been using Tailscale, I am a fan of the product and have used it briefly in the past. I'm looking forward to play with it a bit more. Do you use it? What for?
