I urgently need to pay a visit to the Turkish supermarket. A friend of mine told me a few days ago that they are selling nÃªsperas ([_Eriobotrya japonica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loquat)), or loquats in English. It is a very delicious fruit but it is extremely hard to find here! My parents used to have a tree of them. When I get them, I will definitely post a picture. How much I miss this fruit!
