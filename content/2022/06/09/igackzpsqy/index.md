I was speaking to [@seblog](https://seblog.nl/) about categorisation of contents in our websites and some ideas came into mind:

- Now I have sections for each post type and a special section for posts that should so up in home.
- Sections are automatically added to the posts when they are created based on their [post type](https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts).
- Realistically, who will follow a feed based on the post type? And why?
- [@seblog](https://seblog.nl/) suggests a more audience-based categorisation, such as "personal", "tech", etc. I've had that way back in the past and I really don't remember if it was good or not. However, I understand the appeal.
- [@seblog](https://seblog.nl/) said that types distiction are not that useful, it's just easy to make.
- We both already have tags. But tags feel too overly-specific.
- Both tags and sections are... at the end of the day... taxonomies.
- On my website I could technically achieve this with either tags or sections. Sections seem best as they are more general. Also, audience-based names would not collide with post types so they could still be at the root of the website, such as `/personal` or `/articles`.
- Manually categorising a post every time we post can become arduous.
- Is it worth it?

Let's conclude with **taxonomies are hard**. What do you think?
