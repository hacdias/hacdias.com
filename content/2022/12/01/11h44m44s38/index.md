Folks at work recently released NAT hole punching in libp2p and are now trying to find people to try it out to collect some valuable data. Libp2p is a modular network stack for <abbr title="Peer-to-peer">P2P</abbr> applications. NAT traversal and hole punching are quite important topics when it comes to building p2p applications, since it enables different machines behind NATs to talk to each other. If you care about p2p applications, please [join the experiment](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/call-for-participation-nat-hole-punching-measurement-campaign/1690)! There's more details in the linked page about how it works and the data collected.
