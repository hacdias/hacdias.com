I did that initially, but I've had some specific rules of what to clear from the cache after updating an entry: the entry itself, the main page, the everything page, related sections, taxonomies, as well as yearly, monthly and daily archives. I wonder if this would be too much regeneration and how much _time_ it would take. I think I may try this out over Christmas vacation üòÖ
