    years. Iâ€™m running GoBlog for more than two years already and when adding or refactoring
    things, I regularly find code I havenâ€™t touched in a long time. But because some
    other people use GoBlog as well, I try not to break things and make features opt-in.
    So if I donâ€™t want to use them anymore, I can just disable them. \U0001F604 And
    before implementing something new, I try (that isnâ€™t always working though) to
    think twice whether I really need it."

I think that's good. It means you're reaching a point where you're mostly satisfied with what you have. I've still been doing some big changes lately, usually revolving around _removing_ code. I personally decided to add a big disclaimer on the readme of the repository saying I wouldn't guarantee support for others because I knew I was going to want to change things ðŸ¤£

Recently I've been thinking about the possibility of making Eagle an incremental static website generator. So generate everything statically and then incrementally update when some post is updated. With this, I could remove caching and stuff. At the same time, I could guarantee speed and portability if needed. This was actually something I wanted in the beginning but at the time I didn't think it would be easier to implement.
