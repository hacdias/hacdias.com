  content: I’ve been using Duolingo with Dutch since I moved here. I’ve noticed my
    comprehension skills have improved - albeit not as much as I wish but I also didn’t
    put the effort. I’m thinking of taking actual real classes soon. I think it’s
    important as I’m planning to stay here for the near future. https://cdn.hacdias.com/img/2000/eda77737c2704250e7693eaaa9a1721fcf0e9700aab41dcbea1e1b2625a9db65.jpeg

I would take this statistics with a gigantic grain of salt. I'm sure Duolingo has a massive user base but a large percentage of users are not active users, skewing this statistics.
