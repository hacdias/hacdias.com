  content: 'Iâ€™d never heard of `scrollbar-gutter: stable` (but regularly use `overflow-y:
    scroll`). The former probably looks better on most pages; if certain elements
    are to extend all the way to the edge of the window, an actual scrollbar may provide
    the more consistent look.https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/100daysof-day20/#css
