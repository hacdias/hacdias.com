  content: it took me longer than i&#39;d like to admit to figure this one out (in
    my defense i&#39;m sick and have the worst headache) but today i figured out that
    dithered art has to be moved *two* pixels at a time, not one. moving it one pixel
    causes flicker (left), while two pixels (right) keeps the dither grid in the same
    spot. neat!

That’s definitely very pretty! I didn’t notice at first, but now that I saw it, I can unsee it.
