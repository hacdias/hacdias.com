I really like the idea of Webmentions and Fediverse interactions, as well as displaying them in my website. However, sometimes I go through an old post and look at the webmentions, click on a few, and get a screaming 404 for all of them. That's sad and I absolutely hate having dead links on my website, for I am aware I have too many, including to my own website. What I'm thinking is to hide webmentions for visitors: they will be visible for me as a logged in user, I always receive a notification when receiving one, so if it's a reply, I can always react on it. However, I won't display them on my website.
