  content: In reply to hacdias.com/2022/12/2… I completely understand; I’ll probably
    become a “404” comment too after my time with micro.blog is up (unless there’s
    a way to make a 301 Moved note somewhere) But I still believe in preserving for
    posterity. I have entire tweets replies that have been locked and deleted– saving
    comments to your blog keeps that ephemerality from spreading and you can at the
    very least see where the discussion went, even if the people who typed those words
    have moved on to some other digital domain.

That's definitely a point you have in there. But I wonder to which point that'll be useful for me. Is that something I will really want to keep? I have this mental thing where I feel like keeping information (or things in my website) feels like a burden, especially content from others.
