  content: "Just setting up a quick Mastodon instance to test some compatibility is
    a pain. Using test accounts on public instances is also unreliable, because many
    instances are already overloaded and I donâ€™t want to create spam. So I got a new
    DigitalOcean account with a $200 starter creditâ€¦ DigitalOcean has a simplified
    Mastodon setup and now I can try to improve my ActivityPub implementation during
    the next two months and then probably have to create a new DigitalOcean account.
    By the way, happy holidays! \U0001F384 My familyâ€™s Christmas wasnâ€™t as expected.
    On Wednesday evening I got sick (I guess itâ€™s RSV). But my girlfriend and my sister
    are also sick. \U0001F912 Today is my first day without fever, but it doesnâ€™t
    feel like that."
