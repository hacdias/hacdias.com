    Henrique! I too love fiddling with the site and have added and removed functionalities
    over the years, I think thatâ€™s a normal evolution. Iâ€™ve been pondering on merging
    my game site with Brain Baking for a long time but personally just love the retro
    site layout as itâ€™s reminiscent of past sites and my youth, so I wonâ€™t. Until
    I will. But probably not. Yet. \U0001F605"

Thanks for the comment. Also, FYI, my new URL slugs for notes and quick posts are inspired on yours: I know use the hour, minutes and seconds instead of a random slug ðŸ˜…. That's something I don't think I've ever pointed out, but still a fun fact.
