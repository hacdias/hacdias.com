  content: 'This blog uses WebMention technology. If you write an article on your
    website and mention one of my blog posts, I get a notification. That notification
    can then be published as a comment. It usually looks something like this:This
    means readers of my post can see where it has been mentioned around the web. They
    can read your article after reading mine. Nice!I&#39;ve also set up a &#34;bridge&#34;
    service which looks for people posting comments about my work on social media.
    For example, if you post a link to my blog on Twitter - or reply to someone who
    has shared a link - I get a notification. That means if I think it is an interesting
    comment, I can publish it in the comment section. It usually looks something like
    this:This means readers of my post can see your Twitter or Mastodon comments.
    They&#39;re identified by the logo. Users can go to Twitter or Mastodon to reply
    to you. Nice!Everyone is one big happy family, no matter where on the web you
    are.Or so I thought. There are a few drawbacks with this system.I didn&#39;t write
    that!I had one reader complain that someone else was impersonating them in the
    comments of my posts. It wasn&#39;t immediately clear to them that I&#39;d syndicated
    their comment and reposted it. After that, I added the Twitter logo to make it
    a bit more obvious. But many people still find it unintuitive that content can
    be replicated outside of its original publication.I deleted that!I had another
    reader who automatically deletes their Tweets every month. My blog retains a copy
    of their Tweets because it doesn&#39;t check for deletions. This might be against
    the user&#39;s wishes - especially if they had posted something inappropriate.
    Twitter doesn&#39;t send a &#34;deleted&#34; notification to services which have
    stored Tweets - and it would be impractical to periodically check every single
    Tweet I have stored. The reader was ambivalent about whether they should be kept
    on my blog.I&#39;m not that person any more!One of the comments was a person who
    had changed their name &amp; Twitter avatar. Understandably, they weren&#39;t
    happy about still being referred to by their deadname on my site. Again, neither
    Twitter nor the bridging service notifies me when a user changes their name or
    avatar. Naturally I deleted the comments when they contacted me.I have the copyright
    to that!An overly aggressive person was furious that I&#39;d copied their Â© content
    onto my blog without permission. Personally, I thought that adding their 7 word
    reply was covered by fair-dealing, but I didn&#39;t fancy pissing them off. So
    I deleted it. If I&#39;d embedded directly from Twitter it would have been fair
    game - but some people feel there&#39;s a material difference between embedding
    and copying.Now what?This is a complicated problem. I want to see what people
    are writing in public about my posts. I also want to direct people to the conversations
    which are happening elsewhere on the web. But people - quite rightly - might not
    want their content permanently stored by my site.So I think I have a few options.Do
    nothing. My site; my rules. If you don&#39;t want me to grab your hot takes, don&#39;t
    post them in public. (Feels a bit rude, TBQH.) Be reactive. If someone asks me
    to remove their content, do so. (But, of course, how will they know I&#39;ve made
    a copy?) Stop syndicating comments. (I don&#39;t wanna!) Replace the verbatim
    comments with a link saying &#34;Fred mentioned this article on Twitter&#34; .
    (A bit of a disruptive experience for readers.) Use oEmbed to capture the user&#39;s
    comment and dynamically load it from the 3rd party site. That would update automatically
    if the user changes their name or deleted the comment. (A massive faff to set
    up.) What do you think I should do? Share the love: Mastodon Twitter Facebook

You bring very good points on how ethical it may be to syndicate comments through Webmentions. I personally have been doing option (2), so I remove comments if someone asks me. I've only had that happen once, but my follower base is much smaller! If it becomes a very frequent thing, it may be much harder to manage.
