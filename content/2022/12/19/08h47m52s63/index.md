    from Germany to North Korea with DHL. But instead of arriving there, they were
    either misrouted to South Korea or ended up in China. In a new video, he further
    researches the reasons and also takes a look at DHL’s sorting center in Frankfurt
    at their invitation. Very interesting! Spoiler: The misdirections likely result
    from the fact that many packages are still sorted manually. The resulting environmental
    impact (when a parcel ends up in Australia instead of Austria, for example) is
    of course anything but nice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLqjlTKiR9o'

Thanks for sharing this. I had watched the original videos and I’m very glad this one showed up in my feed somehow. I didn’t expect that so much of the sorting was done manually. Since moving to the Netherlands I’ve had a few packages sorted incorrectly with DHL - it even said so in their tracking website. It explains a lot.
