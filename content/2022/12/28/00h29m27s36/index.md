    functionalities, such as following others. I think it’s possible to just use an
    RSS reader and do it from there… or tie it together with BridgyFed I think. I’m
    after the same holy grail of “one website to do all the things” so that’s why
    I’m looking at GoBlog. Any tips you have on set up and running are very welcome
    and appreciated \U0001F647\U0001F3FE‍♂️"

I'm not using GoBlog, but my own implementation, [Eagle](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle). You should reach out [@jlelse](https://jlelse.blog/), as he's the creator of GoBlog 😅
