  content: 'I packed my bags and moved from my Pleroma instance chat.brainbaking.com/@wouter
    to the Mastodon instance dosgame.club/@jefklak. If you’re on the Fediverse and
    haven’t followed me there, please do, as the move protocol that automatically
    transfers your followers is not properly implemented in Pleroma. I’ll be shutting
    down my instance within a week. Why did I ditch my own instance-of-one server?
    The primary reason is the lack of a true community feeling. The Fediverse is intended
    as a distributed and connected set of small communities where you can feel at
    home, not as a server-per-person system, even though it’s still perfectly possible
    to follow and engage with anyone on other servers. Only then the local timeline
    will be quite empty. Another reason is the dreadful server maintenance problem
    and Pleroma’s opinionated take on some features that, compared to the mainstream
    software Mastodon, sometimes caused little irritations. Plenty of alternative
    communities sounded appealing: scholar.social, dosgame.club, indieweb.social,
    mastodon.vlaanderen. But I’m a scholar now, perhaps not anymore next year, and
    I don’t want to associate myself with only my job. The IndieWeb community is too
    large for my taste (1K+), and .vlaanderen apparently means mostly complaining
    about our government in Dutch. The most satisfying interactions I’ve had over
    the past year with people were related to my other passion: (retro) games. Since
    I grew up with DOS and it’s a small instance, the decision was easy. There’s another
    reason why dosgame.club is appealing: it’s more than just a Mastodon instance!
    The DOS Game Club, dosgameclub.com, is a monthly game club where we play a DOS
    game each month and talk about it in a podcast and on the forums. It’s a very
    nice way to play older single-player games together, get to know new (old) games,
    and share the passion. A game club functions more or less like a monthly book
    reading club. Michael Klamerus over at virtualmoose.org describes a game club
    as follows: A monthly game club is a group that selects a game to play every month
    and discusses the game as they play it. Usually these groups have some sort of
    theme like a console platform or game genre but not always. The clubs can take
    any form but I’ve mostly seen them on Discord since it’s so easy to start one
    up there. They also sometimes have a podcast to discuss that month’s game but
    many do not. Why should you join one? I agree with Michael: it’s a great way to
    play older games, meet new people around the world, and have a community where
    you can discuss your progress, gripes, struggles, gameplay mechanics, … My 486
    and Win98 PCs don’t get much use lately and I hope this will help change that.
    This month, we’re playing through Albion (1995), a unique RPG from Blue Byte,
    the makers of The Settlers. The game is currently $1.25 at GOG.com, and thanks
    to DOSBox and the like, you don’t need to own vintage hardware to run it: in fact,
    most club members just play it on their modern laptop. This time, as it’s a CD-ROM
    game, I don’t even need to bring out the VGA capture card: In Windows 98, print
    screen &amp; pasting in mspaint.exe works wonders: Perhaps it&#39;s time to make
    a run for it...Expect a proper report of my thoughts to be posted soon at Jefklak’s
    Codex! If DOS games aren’t your thing, there are lots of alternatives: the monthly
    playthroughs at the Adventures Gamers forums, a Cartridge Club, or simply start
    your own with a group of friends. Don’t forget to spin up a Mastodon instance
    where your club members can hang out and share their story! tags icon dos mastodon'

Well said! These are some of the reasons why I am considering ditching my own website's ActivityPub support, and simply POSSE to a Mastodon account. It feels very empty, and I also don't think that following ActivityPub accounts via RSS is the best idea due to the volume, yet low content, of posts.
