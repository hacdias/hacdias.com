Today, we are trying to finish painting ðŸŽ¨ the walls of the living room and kitchen. Everything else, except for one wall in the bedroom which will have a different colour, is painted. Unfortunately, I can't help much today because I have to rest my foot due to a tendinitis, which has been a bummer. Got it in Italy but it takes a long time to recover and last week it got a bit worse. My parents are also traveling today to The Netherlands and it's their first time going to a foreign country and second time flying. Well... they have been to Spain next to the border but that doesn't count. So I have to ensure that my foot is the most recovered as it can to show them around a bit over next week.
