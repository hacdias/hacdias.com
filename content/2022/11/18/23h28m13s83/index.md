Today, [Sebastiaan](https://seblog.nl/) shared with me this nice post by Wouter, entitled ["The Great Mastodon Influx"](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/11/the-great-mastodon-influx/). I wanted to add to that that I implemented ActivityPub a few days ago, and I've been improving it since on my spare time. But... I am afraid. I don't have any real followers (just myself from different instances to test). But what if I get a few followers and then get spammed with many requests? Will my tiny server in Finland handle it?

The idea of [POSSEing to Mastodon](/2022/11/09/15h43m59s11) doesn't sound that bad and reduces much of the complexity associated with running a federated server. In addition, what will happen if I want to follow people? I had a very simple idea of creating a private RSS feed with incoming posts from people I would follow. The idea seems reasonably simple. But why reinvent the wheel? There's already client apps for ActivityPub that work well. And I didn't want to have multiple identities. Thoughts?
