I think that is quite a valid reason indeed - there are so many things to [think about](/2022/11/18/23h28m13s83) when implementing ActivityPub, especially incoming things. That is also why I am using the Fosstodon account: to follow people and explore a bit. Later, I would love to support following people from my own website, but I am concerned at both security and speed/resource consumption. Maybe I should implement a queue for both incoming and outgoing things (looking at your implementation ðŸ˜œ) and an extremely simple feed HTTP route that simply consumes the last _n_ activities received and converts them into feed format. Then I can use Miniflux. A thought for later.
