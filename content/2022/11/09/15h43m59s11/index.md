Just like everyone else, I've also been following the stampede - not sure if it's the correct word to translate [debandada](https://dicionario.priberam.org/debandada) -  of people from Twitter to Mastodon. And I've been considering, [again](/tags/activitypub), to add ActivityPub to this website. However, an interesting alternative has surged in the past days: it seems to be [reasonably possible](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/11/05/mastodon-own-donain-without-hosting-server.html) to use my own domain with an external Mastodon instance. Then, I could just [syndicate](https://barryfrost.com/2022/11/i-ve-added-mastodon-syndication-to) from this website to my Mastodon account and use [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) to do its magic on bringing comments and reactions via Webmentions to my website. Just a thought.
