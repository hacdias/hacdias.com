My partner and I got the contract for a new apartment in the past few months. On the 8th of November, we finally got the keys for the new apartment. Being a new apartment in a new building, it comes very barebones. It is also very common in The Netherlands to rent an apartment like this. But what do I mean by "like this"? So the apartment has a kitchen, but no floor, no curtains and no curtain rails. It also has no lights and is not painted. We've painted a bit last weekend and we're getting the floor done next week. Hopefully we'll be able to move by the end of next week! So much work ðŸ˜…
