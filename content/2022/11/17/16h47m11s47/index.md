Today I worked from home instead of my usual co-working space, Microlab. I had a bunch of cranberries I bought the other day left. I bought them because I thought they were going to be nice and sweet but it turns out that they are extremely sour! My partner suggested me to make cranberry syrup the other day. And today I did it! All the cranberries gave two and a half bottles of nice cranberry syrup. Can't wait to use it!
