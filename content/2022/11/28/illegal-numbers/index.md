<abbr title="Today I learned">TIL</abbr> that [illegal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number), and possibly [illegal hashes](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/11/illegal-hashes/), are a thing. But it makes sense. After all, all digital information can be represented as a number. Therefore, a number that represents information that would be illegal under a certain legal jurisdiction is also illegal in such jurisdiction.
