  content: It’s crazy to think how much bandwidth is being used by metadata tags.
    Every company wants to invent it’s own new system. Wouter Groeneveld gives a brief
    overview and recommends getting rid of them (for the most part). I agree with
    him completely. The only one of these systems that my blog supports is Microformats,
    which is quite popular among the IndieWeb community. https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/11/bloggers-dump-your-twitter-card-tags/

Thanks to this and Wouter's post, I just reduced the amount of Open Graph meta tags on my website. I also decided to remove all the Twitter meta tags I was using. There is still some clutter on my website's `<head>` element. I have to clean it up.
