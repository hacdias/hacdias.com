You make some good points. I've been adding AP to my website. I've had it before, and ended up removing it. Sometimes I think about going back to simple static website. I'm afraid the complexity will make it slower, and that AP will just bring a lot of SPAM. But at the same time I want my personal website to be my main online identity ðŸ¤”
