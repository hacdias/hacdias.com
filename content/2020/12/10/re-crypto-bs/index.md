    I am aware that “crypto” originally comes from “cryptography” and cryptocurrencies
    also have to do with cryptography. I was not aware that the Proof of Stake concept
    existed, but it seems like a good idea to reduce the enormous energy consumption.
    Thanks for mentioning it! My frustration is similar, I believe, to that posted
    in this Reddit comment in 2018. Sure, there are certainly good and useful use
    cases for decentralized, tamper-proof databases and digital, anonymous, uncensored
    and privacy-friendly payment methods. But at the moment, it seems to me that cryptocurrency
    trading is more of a gamble with the goal of getting more and more people to invest
    their money in it, and others to cash out and get rich.'

Well, I'm going to try to quickly explain the best I can. First of all, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not interchangeable. Secondly, "crypto" was historically used to refer to cryptography and not cryptocurrencies. I don't agree with whoever started this trend.

> But somehow I don’t understand the whole purpose behind it and I’m beginning to suspect that it’s just a pyramid scheme.

Even though I don't agree with the way Bitcoin works and believe Ethereum is a much better alternative (more on this below), [this documentary](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/bitcoin) is fantastic to explain the problems we have nowadays and how Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) can help solving it. Right now, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on Proof of Work (PoW). PoW is the mechanism that allows the network to come to a consensus and this mechanism uses a lot of electricity. However, Ethereum [is moving](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) to Proof of Stake (PoS), which uses much less energy. Here's a nice [article](https://www.exodus.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/) that quickly explains the differences.

> Wouldn’t there be much better ways to exchange money anonymously and uncensored?

How? I'm pretty sure everyone is open to suggestions.

> In order to generate any kind of coins, a lot of electricity is used (also from fossil fuels or atomic energy),

True, for now. But that was a choice of Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Ethereum is changing. There's more cryptocurrencies, obviously, but I'm not aware of how they all work.

> until today no project based on cryptocurrencies or the blockchain principle has really caught on

I think the main difficulty is making it easier for the end consumer, and also making the end consumer **care**. I know countless of people that are aware that many companies have way too much of their data. But do they care? How to make people care? How to make this technologies easy for people to use without all the technical terms, like public and private keys, addresses, etc?

I actually have some notes on blockchain that are not very explained, but there's so many applications. For example, [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is probably one of my favorites, since they're trustless contracts. The transaction will happen, no matter what. You don't need to trust the other party.

Well, I have to go eat breakfast 😅 Hope I managed to explain something!
