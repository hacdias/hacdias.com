Well... I moved recently and was thinking about setting up a VPN with my new fancy router. But I discovered something: the ISP put me behind a giant NAT. Didn't even know that Carrier Grade NATs were a thing and it never happened to me back in Portugal. Suggestions? I want a simple way to access the network remotely: just for the machines, not for the Internet.
