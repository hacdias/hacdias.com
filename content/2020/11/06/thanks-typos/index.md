  content: s/single/simple/ s/lunchd/launchd/ (unless Apple stores now sell sandwiches,
    I guess...) Otherwise a great article though :) Have you ever considered something
    like org-mode in Emacs? There are a huge number of export options which could
    be used as the basis of a site generator (or just fed into Hugo) and it supports
    inline code quoting allowing for things like Donald Knuth's concept of literate
    programming.

Thanks for noticing the typos. I have considered org-mode for Emacs but I didn't have time, nor patience to go around it and try it as I should. For now I kept using Hugo and publishing some notes here. I might try in the future.
