  content: 'After Kev Quirk was initially skeptical about Git and was desperate about
    using it, he finally made it thanks to community help and realized that Git is
    better than he thought: After 30 minutes I had successfully carried out my first
    commit and push from the Git CLI. I have to say, once the basics had clicked into
    place for me, the whole thing became much simpler to follow. I think I myself
    started using Git when I was programming an Android app with online friends and
    we all wanted to work together on the code base. Back then, I was a full Windows
    user and used the SourceTree tool (because I didnâ€™t know much about the Git CLI).
    Eventually GitKraken came out and became my tool of choice because I could use
    it on Linux as well. Meanwhile I mainly use lazygit. (Which Iâ€™ve already written
    about.) I can do the basic things via the Git CLI (clone, add, comit, push, â€¦),
    but I still prefer to see what I am doing visualized. And often itâ€™s much faster
    and easier that way. For my studies and apprenticeship I had or have to use SVN
    and Iâ€™m really glad that there is Git and so many tools to work with Gitâ€¦'

That's such a nice story. I actually mostly use GitHub's interface and the CLI to work with Git. I only recall using SVN for publishing WordPress plugins a long time ago. I have had to modules during my bachelor's with the same teacher that required us to use the [Concurrent Versions Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) and that one can be a pain. I'm always afraid I'm gonna break something ðŸ˜‚
