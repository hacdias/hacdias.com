A few weeks ago I talked about being undecided whether or not to accept my MSc offer at [TU/e](/2020/03/30/masters). In the meanwhile, I've decided to do so. In the meanwhile, it was revealed today that Dutch universities are planning to to [keep online teaching](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/05/universities-plan-to-carry-on-teaching-online-until-february-2021/) up until February 2021 which is a bit of a bummer. Moving to a different country just to stay in a house for a few months until I can finally get out doesn't seem to be the best experience ever, nor would I get any of the benefits from an international degree. Let's see what's gonna happen on the next months. For now, I'm accepting the offer.
