I just updated my website’s API to support splitting a text into multiple tweets if it’s longer than 280 characters. In addition, in case everything fits one tweet, I won’t be adding a link to my website’s original post… for now. Eventually, I may add it again or remove them at all even if the text doesn’t fit only one tweet. Let’s see… The next step is to also post pictures here.
