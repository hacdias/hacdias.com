  content: I think I have never written so many emails during my entire studies as
    in the last few weeks. But hey, I like to write emails and Iâ€™m really glad that
    my studies are continuing despite Corona (and therefore without any attendance
    events). Especially the flexibility that I can schedule most things freely is
    really good. I have not yet quite decided how I will proceed after my studies,
    but the idea of correspondence courses (possibly alongside work) sounds quite
    tempting.

Interesting... we're having most classes via Zoom. Some via Discord and some are just pre-recorded videos to check out.
