    a tip I have is to try to use more irregular shapes! Maybe a part of the house
    is chipped a little, or a brick is a little broken? Either way, nice work!

@neptzoo thank you so much! I will work on improving and getting to more irregular figures. I really want to do so but not much confident. Need to try it out.
