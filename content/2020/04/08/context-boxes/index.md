Shower thought: do you think the boxes with context about replies, likes and reposts are needed? I'm trying to reduce the complexity and cut edges that I don't think are needed. I could just re-style it in a way to show that it is a like or repost with a link without the "entire" information - which, most of the times, is not the entire stuff because I set a maximum length.

If you're reading this, what's your opinion? Is it really required? Do you find it useful? Or just pretty?
