  content: 'As you can see on my site: at the time of writing I don''t have them.
    I do show a line with a summary of the post. It shows the author''s name, the
    post''s title or just ''a post'' if nothing is available. I have been planning
    for a long time to add context to it, but I would only do that on the detail-pages:
    on feeds I would keep it as is. I think that might work very nicely for your design
    too! But: as long as you show any preview at all, you''re not cutting the complexity
    of the Mf2-fetching. Addition: I like to save the context for my own archive too.
    My site even saves a copy of the image if I like a photo-post, even though it
    does not display. So: I myself would not want to loose the complexity of the Mf2-fetching,
    for it has other benefits.'

You've made good points: if I want to show something, I'll always need to fetch it. I'm actually using [XRay](https://xray.p3k.app/) for it right now which is really straightforward to use. However, as simple as it might be, I'm not happy with the code of my backend API. Some places feel more complex than they should be. I'll need to revisit it soon.

Thanks for letting me know your opinion on this. I'll probably be keeping it as it is right now.
