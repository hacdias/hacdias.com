    useful! (I’m also still searching for a better way to display such context, and
    for now tend to explicitly mention the URL I’m referring to do, and maybe a blockquote.
    Minimal, but works.) I still mostly follow blogs via RSS, however, and items in
    quite a few feeds out there (including yours, it seems) don’t show much context
    at all, which honestly can be a bit confusing.

Didn't expect it to be that useful. I'll be keeping it then. And thanks for reading my blog :D
