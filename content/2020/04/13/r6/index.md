  content: I’m currently browsing the docs of the static site generator Eleventy (also
    known as 11ty). Although I prefer Go and I’m not a big JavaScript (and npm) fan
    for various reasons, I now consider Eleventy as an alternative to Hugo for my
    blog. I’m reaching the limits of Hugo more often and have to find complicated
    workarounds, because it’s almost impossible to add custom functionalities to Hugo.
    Eleventy is apparently very flexible and can be easily extended. I might try to
    rebuild parts of my blog with Eleventy in the near future to see if everything
    is as great as it looks like (and whether Eleventy is as fast as Hugo), but I’m
    also curious to hear more testimonials. https://www.11ty.dev/

Please let me know how it goes! I thought about moving to 11ty when I was setting up my whole "IndieWeb system" but I ended up not doing so. However, sometimes I feel like it'd be much better/simpler to have it all in JavaScript since all the scripts I use to fetch information from here and there are in JS. And it also seems more _flexible_!
