    Interestingly, your h-feeds seem (somewhat) broken now. Like, could your entries
    be missing a u-url? I also seem to be missing photos in older posts—again, in
    my h-feed reader. I’d dig a bit deeper, but “posting from my phone,” etc.

Oopsie! Thanks for letting me know. I noticed there was an issue with the URLs on the feeds (they missed the domain and were relative). Should be fixed now. Can I ask you which reader are you using? So I can check next time before making changes!
