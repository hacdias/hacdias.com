I just spent a lot time trying to send signed requests to accept ActivityPub followers. It's not working! I make the requests to Mastodon and their servers reply with 202 but the 'Cancel follow request' button does not change to 'Unfollow' and I don't know what the problem is. In addition, the test suite has not working for over a year it seems. Ugh...
