I think just successfully added ActivityPub support to my website. You can now follow **@hacdias@hacdias.com** from any ActivityPub instance and receive my latest posts! Here's a [gist](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle/compare/e44bb5f9f78a0d087e0baed223cb98d8324669d2...1ff6b25fa9838e16321517532995ddc160d39494) of the changes I made. For now, I just support follow requests and create requests which are converted to webmentions!
