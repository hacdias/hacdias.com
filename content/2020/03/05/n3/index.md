I'm thinking about adding a photos page to this website and start using Instagram less and less for that purpose. I'd like to serve them with the best resolution possible (not directly, but through a link) but some of them occupy several megabytes of space and I can't afford to add that to Git. In addition, Hugo doesn't seem to play well with Git LFS.

I thought about using BunnyCDN's image optimization service to provide images in different formats and sizes but that costs 9.5â‚¬ a month and I do believe that that would be much more than what I need. Hugo's capable of generating all the pictures I need. However, there's the space problem. Where do I put them?

Also, do you use any CDN? If so, how do you backup the data you have on it?
