Thank you very much! I'm glad you liked them. I prefer to do this type of posts instead of having a photos page like the one I had before. I felt that I needed to follow some style and that I had a limit of pictures. This way I can publish as many as I want, which is nice. However, I'll always try not to put more than 4/5 on one post.
