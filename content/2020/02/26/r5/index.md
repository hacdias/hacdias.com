  content: Could you share more information or code about how you transform your knowledge
    base notes into Hugo pages? I tried creating a wiki or knowledge base on my website
    too, but somehow I still miss a good workflow to make more use of it. And do you
    create all notes directly in English or do you translate them later?

Quickly relying to your last question: the “things I have to import” is because they’re in Portuguese and I wanna translate them. However, this and last semester, most of the material teachers give us is in English (and then the exam is usually in Portuguese which doesn’t make much sense but nevermind). I’ll share more about the entire workflow soon. The best thing is: I don’t do anything basically besides writing the notes :)
