I'm wondering if there's any interesting software to build git based wikis (or at least with a flat file storage) that support Markdown and ACL for private and public posts and is extensible enough to allow me to customize it the way I want. I have a bunch of notes I'd like to make public just because they might be helpful for someone else. I thought about integrating it into this website but I'd love to have a way to have private posts, as well as easily linking between pages. The most interesting option I found was DokuWiki which was tons of plugins. However, it's PHP and I'm not sure about how maintained it is nowadays. It looks like wiki software is dying... besides the big beasts.
