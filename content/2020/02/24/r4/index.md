  content: 'I left Twitter one month ago and didn’t miss it a single time. Reading
    stories about “Brand Blockers” (Medium paywall) just gives me the feeling that
    this was the right decision. Regarding the “Brand Blockers”: Instead of trying
    to block hundreds of thousands brands, maybe just block Twitter? Twitter is full
    of brands. That’s why I first unfollowed everyone and created a list with all
    the people I followed previously, which had the benefit of a chronological timeline
    and no promoted tweets in between. And then I left Twitter altogether. In addition
    to the brand problem there are also politics, scandals, trolls and the attitude
    of people in general. All reasons why I did not want to use this platform anymore.
    Meanwhile I only use Miniflux to follow a selection of blogs, news sites and Fediverse
    accounts. To express my opinion I use my blog. No algorithms that think they know
    what interests me. No promoted tweets.'

I've actually thought about doing this multiple times. Not Twitter actually, but Facebook for now. The only thing that stops me is some university groups that we _only_ have on Facebook that are useful sometimes. However, I already uninstalled it from my phone. Sometimes I wanna show someone something and then I think "I don't have FB installed", but it doesn't matter anyway. Usually it's not something that important.
