  content: Opinions can change over time. And since I often post opinions on my blog,
    I’ve added a feature to my blog theme that displays a warning message above posts
    that are over one year old (example). I have been blogging for some time now.
    There were times when blogging was my escape to deal with difficult times. Some
    things I may see a little bit differently after 4 years. After all, since then
    some years of life experience have been added. I have become more adult. I have
    learned a lot. Today I am no longer as impulsive as I was then. But still, I don’t
    want to delete most of what I published back then just like that. My blog is partially
    a kind of diary and through certain posts I can remember back.

Completely agree with all you've said. "But still, I don’t want to delete most of what I published back then just like that." this is something I've come to learn. My website passed through many phases where I removed a lot of the posts I had there. But now? Now I restored everything.
