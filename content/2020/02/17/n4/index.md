Just wondering if it’s worth it to keep my watches log and checkins on my website. I know I had some work setting that up. But, is it worth it? Is it worth for you, readers?

I like having that data accessible and I still can by just using the APIs and backing up the data myself. It can be useful and it can have many uses. But is it worthy to have on this website?

For maintenance purposes, it’s a bit harder but not impossible. For you, readers. I’d love your opinion on this. I’ve b en thinking about removing swarm checkins because of privacy issues.

About the watches: maybe it’d be nice to have a page listing the series and movies I’ve watched but not as logs.
