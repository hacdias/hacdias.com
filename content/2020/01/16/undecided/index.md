I was going to say that I decided to do incremental builds (this is relative to my previous post) and it's almost done. However, I feel that I need to regenerate too many pages after each update and I might not need that unless someone wants to visit the page... Maybe I'll ditch IPFS support while I don't come up with a good solution for staticness. Or maybe there's a more flexible, still fast, static website generator that I don't know of that would let me use whatever organization I want. Need to think about this.
