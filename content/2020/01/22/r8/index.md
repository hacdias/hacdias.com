    a link to the “interaction”. That removes a lot of complexity with parsing, storing
    etc. but probably isn’t as intuitive: it requires opening the “interactions” section
    below the post and visiting the link."

I enjoy showing the webmention and the context (reply to what? repost of what? like of what?) because, as you know, the content on the Internet is ephemeral and if I don't store it, I don't have assurance that it will remain available. And that's the main reason why I show the webmentions.

In any case, it's not the webmentions that worry me, but the post contexts that I show on replies, likes and reposts... Need to decide on that: either remove the pictures, or store them.
