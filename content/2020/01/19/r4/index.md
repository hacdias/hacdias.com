  content: After talking to @jlelse, I finally decided not to trouble myself with
    writing my own static website generator and just improve what I have right now.
    Optimizing software to run faster is a good thing in itself. If you have to wait
    less for the software to run, you have more time for other things. But if you
    invest hours or days to save a few seconds in the end, then I question if this
    is a good idea. Wouldn’t it be better to start where minutes or even hours are
    regularly wasted? When I invest time in my own software projects, I use most of
    it to create new features that allow me to do new things. This morning, I invested
    a few hours in a feature that allows me to create posts with photos on my blog
    via an app from my smartphone. But what I haven’t done yet, and what I will do
    only when there is a more important reason to do so, is rewriting the software,
    which allows me to receive HTML forms via email, from NodeJS to Go.

Yup, that was my conclusion and I'm really happy I ended up not wasting more time with whatever I was trying to do.

That's great! I actually have a big list of features and things I want to add to my own website. Will start working more on them after I finish my exams.

I love Go but I ended up picking Node.js for the micropub endpoint and all the API that is running on the back of my website just because it was easier to deal with... for now.
