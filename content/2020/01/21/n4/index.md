I wanted to have a cleaner look on this website and make an about page instead of dumping that on the frontpage. However, I don't feel like the current ~~All page~~ looks that good so... I don't know.

In addition, I'd like to refactor my header to have more room to add more links instead of having them in the footer. Some of them may stay there, but I'd like to bring Bookmarks to the top and two other future pages I want to make ([Now](https://nownownow.com/about) and [Uses](https://uses.tech/)).
