Just made a few updates to my website:

- Removed Tachyons.
- New roomy header: took some inspiration from [@jlelse's](https://jlelse.blog) and from a previous version of my website.
- Added two new pages that have no information yet: now and use. You can find them on the header.
- I now have a [blogroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_blogging) that you can find [here](/blogroll).
- If you look at the bottom of the page, you now have links for all the categories too.

This seems to be a small update. Maybe some won't like the new design as much as the previous one,  but I assure you: it's at least 70 KB smaller! At least! I didn't actually measure it ðŸ˜‹

I may make some updates in the future, but for now I have some interesting plans for the now page!
