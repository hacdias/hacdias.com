  content: Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, wrote about “why using WhatsApp is dangerous”,
    citing the attack against Jeff Bezos. Second, there are backdoors. Enforcement
    agencies are not too happy with encryption, forcing app developers to secretly
    plant vulnerabilities in their apps. I know that because we’ve been approached
    by some of them – and refused to cooperate. As a result, Telegram is banned in
    some countries where WhatsApp has no issues with authorities, most suspiciously
    in Russia and Iran. I’m still using WhatsApp, because I’m more or less forced
    to do so (important groups etc.), but Telegram is by far my favorite messenger,
    not necessarily because it’s “more secure”, but because it has a way better user
    experience. Cross device cloud chats work perfectly when using multiple computers
    and smartphones. However, I wish Telegram would open-source their backend code
    too. https://telegra.ph/Why-Using-WhatsApp-Is-Dangerous-01-30-4

I really love Telegram and love it! I known a few folks that also prefer Telegram over any other messaging platform. I think that most people would enjoy it more than what they use right now if they tried the app. However, it's a bit hard to make people start using new services when they're used to the same steps everyday. Inertia.
