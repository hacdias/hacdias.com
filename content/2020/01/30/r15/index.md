  content: "I think I’m in some kind of bubble, but most of the people I instant message
    with use Telegram, because either they are computer science students too or because
    I convinced (or persuaded) them. My top features (that can convince geeks) are:
    cross device cloud sync (with clients for almost any platform and perfect notification
    handling), bots and the bots API (I use that for two of my projects) and night
    mode. Features that can probably convince “normal” people: It’s fast, it looks
    pretty and is highly customizable, it doesn’t waste storage (because you can configure
    to just keep files cached for a specific time) and stickers (also animated stickers).
    And not to forget: You can message people and they won’t see your phone number
    unless you explicitly share it with them (at least when you configured a username)!
    But yeah, it’s still hard to change people’s routines. \U0001F612"

Uh! That's pretty awesome. In my case, over 50% of the people I talk every day are not on telegram. I've convinced some (including my parents!) with the arguments you mentioned, but others are just to lazy to change or they don't bother about the eventual benefits even if they complain about things that Telegram would solve when compared to other services: storage usage is my favorite point here. Also, cross-platform syncing and not losing everything just because you changed systems...
