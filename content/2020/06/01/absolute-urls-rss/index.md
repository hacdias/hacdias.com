  content: Thatâ€™ll be hard to do with Hugo. Thereâ€™s no way to tell it to use absolute
    URLs in the feeds only. Iâ€™ll need to set up an extra step of some kind. Iâ€™ll check
    it out. I use a partial in my Hugo theme to replace relative links with absolute
    links in the content in XML (RSS) and JSON (JSON Feed, ActivityStream) files.
    It has a regular expression to find and replace all relative links with their
    abolute version. Itâ€™s probably easy to modify to replace relative image sources
    too.

Wow! Thanks Jan. I'm still trying to understand why replacing links that start with `/` work because my feed was printing relative URLs with `..`. It seems to work though. I'm happy ðŸ¤¯

There are some `srcset`s from some older articles that have relative URLs but let's hope no one will take a look at those old posts. Maybe I'll try to figure out a way to parse those attributes. Would be a bit more complicated though.
