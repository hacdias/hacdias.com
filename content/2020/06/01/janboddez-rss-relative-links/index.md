Thanks 😁

Thanks for letting me know that. I didn't know that was an issue. May I ask which RSS reader you're using? That'll be hard to do with Hugo. There's no way to tell it to use absolute URLs in the feeds only. I'll need to set up an extra step of some kind. I'll check it out.

Interesting, I noticed today my ActivityPub feeds had that problem and I already fixed them to include the "reply" part. I'm not aware if the RSS can have that kind of context. Can they? Also, just checked and the JSON feeds don't support that kind of things. However, my page's all use microformats and I just checked and they're correctly parsed.
