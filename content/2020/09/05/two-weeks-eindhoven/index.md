I have been living in Eindhoven, The Netherlands for two weeks already! Isn't that crazy? So far, I've only had one week of (remote) classes. What bothers me most is that most professors just decided that we should watch the videos of the lectures from previous quarters (because they already recorded them). In addition, all three courses I have this quarter are fully evaluated by a single exam that just counts 100% of the grades. Very theoritical so far. However, I know that some other courses later on are not like this. Other than that, it's being an amazing experience.

(The post services in the Netherlands are super fast)
