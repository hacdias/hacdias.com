    \U0001F1E9\U0001F1EA, the last days even more often in German than in English.
    And this although there will be much less people reading these articles. Somehow
    it is much easier for me to write texts in my mother tongue. The words flow much
    better and it is much easier for me to express my thoughts. I will probably write
    more about my life and stuff like that on my German blog, while my English blog
    will be more about technical topics. Some things, like my monthly reviews (the
    next one will be this week) I will also publish in both languages. Maybe itâ€™s
    also just a little alternation again. Weâ€™ll see. I just do it the way I enjoy
    it, after all blogging is my hobby."

That's really interesting. Even though my mother tongue is clearly not English, sometimes I find it much easier to express some thoughts in English rather in Portuguese. I feel the best for me would be to write in both at the same time but that's obviously not good for readers ðŸ˜‚
