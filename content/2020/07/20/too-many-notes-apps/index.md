Taking notes is a process... that's true. Yesterday I found a post on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23888799) talking about how tired people are of new notes apps. I agree: there's so many different note-taking apps that it becomes unbearable to find whatever fits you. I have a giang repository of markdown files with images and a lot of notes, all interconnected. And I still couldn't find a good app for me. That's why I'm considering building one simple system for myself, initially private to avoid possible noise, and then open source. My requirements for a system are these:

**Must-have**:

- Self hosted and open source
- Notes stored in plain text files
- Backlinking feature
- Supports LaTeX math
- Supports Mermaid diagrams
- Clean layout and possible to easily edit on mobile
- Web editor (maybe WYSIWYG)
- Simple and humanly readble markup language (markdown or other)
- Search

**Good to have**:

- Full-text search
- Mind map visualization
- Public/private stuff

Do you know any application that accomplishes all of this cumulatively? I liked [this](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) visually and there's also [this](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) being built but I have no clue about when's it going to be available or how the storage will work.

If I would create this, it would be just yet another note-taking app, but with a small difference in mind: this would be directed to be self-hosted for just one person. No services, for myself, as I wanted it to work.
