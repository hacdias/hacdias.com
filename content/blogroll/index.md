In this page, you can find an alphabetically sorted list of blogs, websites and people that I follow. Some types of websites, such as newspapers, I do not include. This list is automatically updated every day with new data from my [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) instance. For other kinds of links, I also have [bookmarks](/bookmarks) page.
