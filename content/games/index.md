I am not a person that plays a lot of games. However, there are some games that have a special place in my heart, or that I enjoy playing sometimes. I want this page to be used to track the games I play, or that I have played, as well as some progress information about them.

## 💿 PlayStation Portable

The [PlayStation Portable](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable) (PSP), from Sony, was my first console ever and gifted to me by my godmother. At the time, I was around 10 years old and I don't think my parents thought it was a great idea. However, I was extremely happy with this purchase.

I must say that the PSP served me well during its life-time. At some point, it stopped working properly and I ended up selling it for pieces and giving most of my games to my cousin. Therefore, I only have vague memories of the games I owned. Nevertheless, here's a list of the games I remember playing:

- **Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters** - one of my favorite games ever according to my memory. I don’t think I ever completed the game but I had surely had a lot of fun playing it. 
- **Special Agent Clank**
- **Burnout Legends**
- **Buzz Master Quizz**
- **Daxter**
- **LittleBigPlanet**
- **Sonic Rivals**
- **‌Invizimals**
