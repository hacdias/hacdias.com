I started this website in 2014, when I was 14. At the time, all the content was in Portuguese, and I was running multiple blogs. After a while, I decided to start writing in English hoping it would improve my English skills, which I can argue that worked. Nowadays, all other blogs I had are merged under the current domain.

This website has seen quite a few redesigns. I [wrote](/2022/03/25/my-website-before-indieweb) about all the main designs I had before this website was part of the IndieWeb community, and [after](/2022/06/18/my-website-after-indieweb). I am still not 100% settled on the current design. However, major changes are slowing down, which means I might be coming to a good point where I am mostly satisfied.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does This Website Work? {#how}

With the exception from a few pages, this website is statically-generated by [Hugo][hugo], my favorite website generator. This website has been generated by Hugo [since 2015][hello-hugo], except during a [short][bye-hugo] [period][hello-again] between November 2021 and April 2023. During this period, I was running my own custom backend, called Eagle.

[Eagle] is still backing this website for certain things, such as generating the search results, processing incoming and outgoing Webmentions, and authentication. Other than that, the website is purely statically-generated by Hugo.

This website currently relies on a bunch of services, such as [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [Bunny](https://bunny.net/). I would like to move out of Cloudflare in the future due to their latest historic with down time. However, I haven't spent some time doing that yet. Other software I use can be found in my [uses] page.
