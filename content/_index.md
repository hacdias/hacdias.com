**Hi 👋, I’m Henrique** (he/him), a Portuguese 🇵🇹 guy living in The Netherlands 🇳🇱. I'm a software engineer 🛠 interested in web infrastructure, decentralized systems, identity, and making tools for developers and users. I enjoy learning about new things, taking photographs, programming, as well as a nice cup of coffee or tea. Welcome to my Internet peninsula!
