**Hi, I’m Henrique 👋**, a software engineer based in The Netherlands 🇳🇱, originally from Portugal 🇵🇹. I'm passionate about open source, user agency, decentralization, identity, and building impactful tools and products. In my free time, I enjoy staying active, programming, photography, and a nice cup of coffee or tea. Welcome to my corner on the web!
