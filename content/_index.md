**Hi, I’m Henrique 👋**, a software engineer based in The Netherlands 🇳🇱, originally from Portugal 🇵🇹. I'm passionate about open source, user agency, decentralization, identity, and building impactful tools and products. In my free time, I enjoy staying active 💪, photography 📷, programming 💻, or a great cup of coffee or tea ☕️. Welcome to my corner on the web!
