**Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Henrique**, a Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ guy living in The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. I'm a software engineer ðŸ›  who cares about the web, decentralization, identity, user agency, and making impactful tools for developers and users. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, taking photographs, programming, or a nice cup of coffee or tea. Welcome to my Internet peninsula!
