**HI 👋, I'M HENRIQUE** (he/him), a Portuguese 🇵🇹 living in The Netherlands 🇳🇱. I'm a recently graduated 🎓 master's student, and a software engineer 🛠 interested in web infrastructure, decentralized systems, identity, and making tools for developers and users. I enjoy learning about new things, taking photographs, playing badminton, programming, as well as a nice cup of coffee ☕️ or tea 🍵. Welcome to my island on the Internet 🏝️, where you can find a bit of [everything](/more)!
