title: Places That I Have Visited
description: A list of the trips I took in the past.
---

This is where I list the trips ðŸš… I have done in the past. I like keeping a record of where I have been in the past, what for and how I got there. Day trips are not included, unless they involve going to another country. I also record some traveling goals in my [impossible list](/impossible-list) page, as well as track where I have been using [Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com/), for more fine grained information of what I have visited.
