title: Places That I Have Visited
description: A list of the trips I took in the past.
---

This is where I list the trips ðŸš… I have done in the past. I like keeping a record,
albeit small of where I have been in the past, and what for. I also record some
traveling goals in my [impossible list](/impossible-list) page. In addition, I
might also list a future trip if it involves certain types of events, such as conferences.
