In the 90s and early 2000s, having a guestbook on one's website was a common practice and a way for everyone to share their opinions about each other's corner of the web. I find it an amazing idea so feel free to drop off a few lines or just say hi. Hope you enjoyed navigating my corner in the Internet!
