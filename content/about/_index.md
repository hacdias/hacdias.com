<span id='greetings'>**<span id='hello'>Hi, I'm</span> <span style="color: var(--c)">Henrique</span>! üëã**</span>

I come from a little town in the countryside of Portugal üáµüáπ, and I've been living The Netherlands üá≥üá± for a few years. I'm a software engineer who cares open source, user agency, decentralization, identity, and building impactful tools and products. In my spare time, I enjoy staying physically active, photography, programming, or a nice cup of coffee or tea.

I started playing with computers at an early age. When my father bought his first computer, I carved a monitor, keyboard and mouse from the cardboard boxes and made my own "computer". As the years passed, I decided to learn programming. I spent hours researching which programming language to learn first and decided on C#. I bought a book, which I never read, and ended up learning PHP instead.

During secondary school, I had the opportunity to write for [Pplware](https://pplware.sapo.pt/), which is one of the largest tech blogs in Portugal. At the same time, I had the opportunity to do some software development work for [Upframe](/2017/07/12/how-did-i-start-working-remotely-at-a-startup/), which was the time I started getting introduced to a bit more of the startup world.

After secondary school, in 2017, I moved to Lisbon to pursue a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/). A few months after, I got recruited by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), where I had the opportunity to work on the decentralization of the web in a full open source manner. I am forever grateful for this [opportunity](/2018/10/27/working-at-protocol-labs/).

A few years later, in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I [moved](/2020/03/30/a-new-adventure/) to [The Netherlands](/2025/08/06/road-to-eindhoven/), where I [obtained](/2022/11/25/msc-graduation-ceremony/) my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering degree at the [TU/e](https://tue.nl). Moving to a new country - especially during such turbulent times - has given me the opportunity to grow in ways I was not expecting and a new place to [call home](/2024/01/10/when-does-abroad-stop-being-abroad/).

After finishing university, in 2022, I joined Protocol Labs full-time. About a year and a half in, I decided to say goodbye to the interplanetary journey, and join [Ver.iD](https://ver.id/), where I worked on building a platform to verify and issue verifiable credentials into identity wallets. I now work at [Animo Solutions](https://animo.id), where I get to work on open-source projects in the decentralized identity space. On the side, I work on [open source](https://github.com/hacdias) projects, usually related to the IndieWeb, or just contributions here and there.

I [started](/2014/07/12/apresentacao/) this website back in 2014, when I was just 14. At the time, I was running multiple blogs, in multiple languages. After a while, motivated by the idea of improving my English skills and reduce the amount of websites I was running, I [unified](/2015/02/11/i-have-moved-again/) all of them under a single roof. The website has also seen quite a [few](/2022/03/25/my-website-before-indieweb) [redesigns](/2022/06/18/my-website-after-indieweb) over the years, but that has not changed as often in the recent times.

For the longest time, this website has been statically-generated by [Hugo](/2015/08/12/farewell-wordpress-hello-hugo/), but things [have](/2021/11/19/farewell-hugo-hello-eagle/) [changed](/2023/06/13/farewell-eagle-kinda-hello-hugo/) a few times. In addition to Hugo, there's [Eagle](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle), which is a custom made engine to support additional, more dynamic features, like [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) integrations and the search page.

All the content on this website is produced by me, including photos. It is, by default, copyrighted unless otherwise noted. I do not use LLMs or other AIs to write or generate any of the content of this website. Other tools I use, whether to run this website, or not, can be found in my [uses](/uses/) page. I also write often about how this website [works](/tags/meta/).
