This is a digital shoebox, similar to [this one](https://gilest.org/shoebox.html). I tend to keep around many boxes with random things over time, both physically and digitally. This is a place for some of those things that can be public, or that I've wanted to share before, but they weren't easily accessible. Welcome to my digital shoebox 📦!
