      "content": "December is concluding and with it, we’re closing in the end of 2022. With the end of this month, I am writing one more retrospective about the events that have happened in my life during the past month. I am still on the fence whether or not I am writing a “year in review”. I will likely do a post for music and one for movies and TV shows with some stats. But I’m not sure I will write a generic year in review.✍️ WebsiteI made quite a few updates over the last month to this website, both in terms of functionality and appearances. One of the most (in)visible changes is that I removed support for private posts, as well as login for other people. That is something I ended up not using for over a year so I thought: why not remove it.In terms of content, I split the “Food \u0026amp; Drinks” section again. Now I have a section for 🥘 Food and a section for 🧋 Drinks. I think this was the right decision. I want those to be a gallery-like view of things I ate and drunk, but not together. I may change how they are displayed in the future in order to be a grid-like setting.Inspired by Tim’s Logs, I updated my 📚 Readings, 🎬 Watches and ✏️ Articles pages. In addition, I created a new section, called 🚀 Trips. Each trip shows a listing of all the posts published during the trip. How neat is that?Finally, I updated the way the 🗞️ Blogroll is displayed to include the favicon of each website that I follow. This was inspired by Jim’s External Links page. Sadly, it uses an API from Google. However, I may end up proxying it and caching the results in the future.🍄 LifeFaro AirportLife-wise, quite a few things happened, but I’m going to be quicker on this section. For once, we finished most of the construction in the apartment. We have almost all furniture and everything is mostly settled in. In addition, we went to Aachen’s Christmas Market, where we had a lot of fun. I love Christmas Markets 🎄! In the end of the month, I spent a week at my parent’s in Portugal and it was a very nice time to meet with a lot of family that I haven’t seen in a while.Sadly, I’m still “suffering” from my Achilles tendinitis, or tendinopathy, as I think it actually is. I will ask the physiotherapist next time. It bothers me quite a lot and I feel extremely limited. If I walk a bit more, it will hurt, the day after. That’s the thing about tendons: you never know if you’re over-exerting them. And on top of all of it: I’ve lived my all life in hilly areas and never have I had a problem like this. I move to a flat country and this happens… Let’s hope this will get fixed during the first months of 2023!📚 ReadingI finally finished reading “The Island of Missing Trees”. I had started this book back in June, so this took a long time. Mostly because I procrastinated a while since then and basically took a months long break of reading, which is sad. Nevertheless, it was a very good book, which you can read more about in my little review.🍿 WatchingI watched quite a few things during December. However, I want to highlight a few. In the movies department, I went to the cinema twice. The first time, I watched The Menu. I had absolutely no clue what the movie was about, but apparently, according to Wikipedia, it’s a “black comedy horror movie”. I’m not exactly sure if I would call it that, but psychological horror, definitely. It was quite nice, in the sense that it was quite unexpected and the idea behind it is quite well executed in my opinion.The second time I went to the cinema was to watch Avatar: The Way of Water and I absolutely loved it. I watched the first movie years ago when I was a kid, so I first had to watch a recap of the first movie. The second movie is a great continuation of the first. Of course, some will enjoy it more than others, but overall it was worth it.Meeting a Water Tribe (Avatar: The Way of Water)On the series department, I want to highlight three series. First of all, 1899. 1899 is a series from the same German studios as Dark, and you can clearly see why. Even though the story is extremely different and unrelated, the philosophy behind it, as well as the mysterious tone are highly present and connected. In addition, the multi-cultural nature of the cast was impressive, with actors from all corners of the world. I really enjoyed watching the first season of 1899 and I am thrilled for what’s coming next. I recommend it, as well as Dark, and Making 1899 for the technology behind it.Passengers on Board of Kerberos (1899)I also watched the first season of Wednesday, which follows the story of Wednesday Addams. I did not have a lot of background on the Addams Family story, but I enjoyed the execution and storyline. Also looking for the next seasons.Finally, I want to highlight the second season of White Lotus 🪷, which follows the story of Tanya that was in the first season. It was tragic, but fun and cosy at the same time.And this was my December in Review. I think this was my longest monthly recap I’ve ever written and I quite enjoy this format, splitting between different sections. I will likely continue to do this!",

      "content": "May was a loooong month in the sense that a lot happened. It is crazy to think that we’re now starting the sixth month of 2022, which means that we’re nearing the first semester of this year. It feels like it just started.With time, I’ve been logging more and more things in this website, from movies I watch, to places I’ve been and even concerts. Sometimes I feel like it isn’t worth it to write a “month in review” since everything is on my website already. However, here am I!MoviesI watched both “Downton Abbey: A New Era” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once” in the cinema in May. Both were incredible in their own ways. I would recommend anyone that followed the Downton Abbey series to watch the movie. It gives a nice continuation, and ending, to the story we’ve all been looking for.Regarding the second movie whose title is very large - “Everything Everywhere All At Once” -, I recommend it to everyone. This is a movie that surpassed my expectations and I cannot believe how little people were involved in the realisation of this movie compared to other big-name movies.PlacesI’ve been in many places last month: Brussels, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, somewhere in Zeeland and I wouldn’t be surprised if I missed some place. I was fortunate to see Marina’s concert in Brussels and MØ’s in Amsterdam. I also had a Charli XCX concert planned for last weekend but, sadly, it was canceled.ThesisMy thesis has been progressing quite well in my opinion which is making me really happy. I will, however, aim to defend it in September only as it would be quite tight to do it before everyone goes for holidays in August. There’s no rush either. I hope I can deliver a successful and meaningful presentation.It was a really really good month. I hope you also had a great May and that June will bring happiness! Also, Happy Pride Month 🏳️‍🌈",

      "content": "In 2015, I posted an article with a very similar name to this one. At the time, I was saying goodbye to WordPress and welcoming Hugo. As with everything in life, there are cycles and things change. It’s time to turn a new page on this website’s life cycle.Around a year ago, I explained why I was rebuilding my website’s CMS, Eagle. At the time, I decided against completely replacing Hugo, the static website generator I’ve been using for years, because it worked. However, a year has passed and I’ve thought many times about replacing Hugo and I finally did it.Since November 15th, I have been running the new version of Eagle. Hopefully, you didn’t notice as nothing broke for you. If it did, please let me know! In this new system, completely powered by Eagle, there’s no Hugo or static page building anymore.Building v2Building Eagle v2 was a mixed experience: it was both faster and more challenging than I thought. I’ve been relying on some features of Hugo, such as shortcodes, for years. These allow me to define custom “functions” for markdown. Fortunately, I managed to replace them either by just copy pasting their HTML code - if they were used 1 or 2 times - or add a custom node to Goldmark, the markdown parser library I use.With v2, I have feature parity with what I had with Hugo. I also added yearly, monthly and daily archives, as well as 410 Gone for deleted posts. There’s also XML feeds, besides the already existing JSON and ATOM feeds.More importantly, I brought back Micropub support, which I removed around a year ago for no reason. I also implemented IndieAuth and now I don’t need to use IndieAuth.com to login anymore.If you look at my more page, you’ll notice that there’s a lot of different content categories (or “sections”) now. I brought back the checkins and watches, which I had removed before because they were slowing down the Hugo build process.Everything is stored as markdown files. However, there’s a PostgreSQL instance running to index my posts and help me generate indexes and the nice summaries for some of the sections.And a lot more!What’s next?I am far from done! Since Monday until today, I have implemented a few other features that I wanted, but the list is always growing. I’m sure you’ll see a new post lurking here and there about a new feature coming out.",

      "content": "Over the past months, I have been reading more and more posts where people are saying they miss the vibe of the 90s web. Even though I wasn’t alive to see how that web was, I still remember the website of my high school filled with overly saturated colors, GIFs and iframes. Not only that characterizes some of the pages of the early web, but also the pixelation and the footers saying to use X or Y browser. We know those kinds of websites are a mirage nowadays, but some of them are still accessible via the Internet Archive. There is one really interesting service called Neocities, which I talked about in the past, that aims to bring the glory of the Geocities to today’s web.It’s amazing to see how those “retro” websites emanate personality: from the simplest GIF to the hyper customized text, from the guestbooks to the easter eggs. Those were mostly written by hand with no automatic generation. It’s just a completely different feeling from what we have right now.I barely remember when I first created this website, but I believe it was by hand, and it must’ve been fun. Shortly after, I moved to Hugo, a static website generator, and I’ve never looked back. Although Hugo allows us to create websites with ease, we still have tons of customization power because it just does exactly what we want to.On his essay, Parimal talks about how today’s websites are mainly built towards product selling or marketing. It’s a really good post and I recommend you all to read it.With all of thing being said, I have been tweaking my website. “Again?\", you ask. “Yes, again”, I say. My website has changed a lot over the few years since it exists (5 years I believe), but mostly on the past months, probably due to my discovery of the IndieWeb and the pandemic we’re living right now.My idea for this website is to make it a hub of my online identity and that’s what I’ve been building over the past months: from the now page to the watches page, everything tries to show a bit more of me and what I like.To bring more of the 90s vibe to this website - I hope - I decided to add more emojis and GIFs everywhere. The emojis are actually just a comeback because I already used them immensely in the past. I’m actually using Twemoji from Twitter to make the emojis look the same cross-platform. I’m self-hosting everything though so I don’t need to rely on external CDNs. However, let me know what you think.In addition to just adding emojis and GIFs, I decided to make my home page more personal instead of just a listing of my most recent posts. It now features a brief description of myself, a summary of what I am doing right now, links for featured posts, links to other pages - hence removing the “More” page - and, last but not the least, a link to my guestbook.With this update, I’m hoping to make this website more alive. Even though the mobile version hasn’t changed that much - mainly due to the device’s screen size -, the desktop version is much richer and entertaining, hopefully. I’m trying to join the old with some modern, yet interesting, features such as webmentions.A more subtle change I made was to change the dates on this website to use the Holocene Calendar which adds exactly 10 000 years to the current year, being the first year placed in the beginning of the Holocene era.Let’s bring the web more personality, more presence, more uniqueness. Let’s be the painters 🎨 of our own identity.Feel free to check out my guestbook and leave a comment! You can just say “hi” if you want, I’ll deeply appreciate it 😃 Do you have suggestions, leave a comment too!",

      "content": "Inspired by Henrique Dias and his “Watches” page, I added such a site to my website too. I’m not using a tracking service to collect the data though, but write down everything manually. Although doing it automagically is pretty cool. I just try to keep things under my own control and don’t want to start to depend on yet another service.For entries I try to link to The Movie Database, a more open alternative to Amazon’s IMDb. When shows or movies are note available there, I’ll like to the streaming platform’s detail platform or another adequate website.I watch a lot more movies and shows lately and so I want to keep track of it.",
