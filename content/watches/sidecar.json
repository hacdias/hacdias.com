      "content": "Inspired by Henrique Dias and his “Watches” page, I added such a site to my website too. I’m not using a tracking service to collect the data though, but write down everything manually. Although doing it automagically is pretty cool. I just try to keep things under my own control and don’t want to start to depend on yet another service.For entries I try to link to The Movie Database, a more open alternative to Amazon’s IMDb. When shows or movies are note available there, I’ll like to the streaming platform’s detail platform or another adequate website.I watch a lot more movies and shows lately and so I want to keep track of it.",
