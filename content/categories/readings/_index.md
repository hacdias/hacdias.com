![Man Reading Book](https://cdn.hacdias.com/media/2022-03-man-reading.gif?class=right+pixelated+book) This is my bookshelf with all books I remember reading in the past, or that I'm reading now or want to read in the near future. Most of them are in Portuguese since I read them thorough my childhood and teenage years. Many books added before 2021 may not have the correct reading dates attached.
