  content: 'Reply to: https://hacdias.com/2023/01/02/15h06m13s43Havenâ€™t used Windows
    in quite some time, but I like to keep following the news as it was the OS that
    accompanied my childhood, most specifically Windows XP and Windows 7. Somehow
    I managed to skip Windows Vista, apart from some few interactions in someone elseâ€™s
    computer. Then, Windows 8 came and Windows 10 and I ended up moving to macOS for
    some other reasons and so far, havenâ€™t gone back. I always enjoyed Window UI,
    at least to some extend. This article shows UI elements present in Windows â€¦Yeah,
    itâ€™s funny how much old Windows is still in Windows 11. However, the parts with
    old design elements are probably all not often used ones. And why change something
    just for the sake of change? How is the situation on macOS?'

I think it's better in the sense that the UI is much more consistent across the whole operating system. However, there's odd things here and there. And Apple has made some questionable choices in the recent versions too ðŸ˜….
