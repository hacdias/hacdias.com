  content: "2022 is over, welcome 2023! A year full of unexpected events, many personal
    changes and a lot of new experiences… But since I wrote a review every month,
    I just want to highlight the highlights here. The year already started with the
    first big change: I moved out of my parents’ house or apartment after more than
    22 years. In January, I looked at two apartments and immediately snapped up the
    second one. After spending January and February cleaning out and packing, I moved
    into my first own apartment in March. It was a step that made me grow personally
    once again. I have lived alone for the last few years, but having my own place
    is something else. February was a terrible month in terms of the situation in
    the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, a war that not only marked the past year, but
    will certainly be very present for several years to come. Why are some people
    so cruel? March consisted, as I said, of moving, then in April I settled into
    my new apartment and also did more programming again, such as further improving
    my blog software. As for this, there was no slowdown in new or improved features
    last year. The much programming has probably only led to the fact that I simply
    blogged less (publicly), roughly only half as much as in 2021. But I’m not bound
    to numbers and I just blog when I feel like it, so all good, maybe it will be
    more again in 2023. Not only did I turn 23 in May, I was also looking for a new
    employer after almost 5 years. I was a bit frustrated and didn’t see many future
    prospects, so I responded to recruiter requests, attended interviews and finally
    found a new job starting in September that I enjoy more again, working with newer
    technologies, 100% remote opportunity and new challenges. After a few months it
    turns out to be absolutely the right decision. In June, July and August, there
    was the 9-Euro-Ticket in Germany, whose end made me sad in September and whose
    continuation as a 49-Euro-Ticket I am already looking forward to. Not having to
    pay 3 euros for every trip within the city or being able to visit my girlfriend
    cheaply or take a weekend trip to another city was brilliant. Especially as someone
    who no longer owns a car (as, by the way, more people in Germany do than some
    privileged fellow citizens might think), it offered a rarely seen flexibility.
    But I didn’t only travel by train a lot within Germany in 2022, I also went on
    vacation to Croatia in August in a climate-friendly way by train. It was not very
    relaxing, but possible and a great experience that brought back a bit of memories
    of my Interrail trips in 2015 and 2017. For 2023 we are also already thinking
    about where we can go by train. Maybe Great Britain? The flexibility through the
    company agreement in the new job, which allows me to work remotely up to 100%
    (because my colleagues are spread all over Europe anyway), not only offered me
    the possibility to work more often at my girlfriend’s or my family’s place, it
    also reignited the idea to move in with my girlfriend, because for two years,
    since my girlfriend had started her studies, we had a long-distance relationship.
    In October we had a few apartment viewings and finally got an acceptance for a
    cozy 2-room apartment in Kassel. I’m keeping my apartment in Braunschweig, just
    in case I want to work in an office some day and because we plan to have our center
    of life in Braunschweig in the long run (after my studies and possibly my girlfriend’s
    teacher training). It’s a good thing that the new job also allows me financially
    to run two households. Then in November we moved. And in December, I finally spent
    the Christmas season (partly sick) with my family and celebrated New Year’s Eve
    with my girlfriend’s family. So, all in all, a lot happened for me in 2022, but
    mainly positive things, which I am very happy about and which, in view of world
    events, is not a matter of course at all. I am very happy that, despite inflation
    and the energy crisis, I and my loved ones lack nothing important and we do not
    (have to) freeze. For 2023 I wish that the situation in the world improves again,
    that mankind stops fighting each other and finally starts to stop the climate
    crisis. I also wish for a bit more routine in everyday life again without the
    almost daily negative news, that I finally manage to start exercising again and
    that the 49-Euro-Ticket comes as soon as possible. \U0001F605"
