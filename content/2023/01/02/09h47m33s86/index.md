It really depends on what you're looking for. If it's ActivityPub, [this article](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/) is a good starting point. If it's IndieWeb-related technologies, [their wiki](https://indieweb.org/) is very good. For my website's source code in specific, you can always check it directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle). Hope those links help!
