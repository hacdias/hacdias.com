    for a 6 hour trip from the Netherlands to Switzerland. It’s my second trip on
    a long course train through Germany. It’s also my second time that the train gets
    delayed in Germany due to a fire. We’re now being diverted and getting a massive
    delay. Germany… please hold onto your fires.At least it’s just a fire and no Personenschaden
    (personal damage?)… Always, ALWAYS expect delays when travelling by train through
    Germany. \U0001F643 And make use of your passenger rights!"

My compensation rights go through NS because I bought the ticket with them. And NS only refunds money after 1h delay. We’re over 1h delayed now but we’re expected to be able to recover part of it. After I arrive at my final destination I’ll look into it.

Update: I am definitely missing my Eurocity train connection in Basel. That is certain.
