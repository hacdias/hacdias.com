    go through NS because I bought the ticket with them. And NS only refunds money
    after 1h delay. We’re over 1h delayed now but we’re expected to be able to recover
    part of it. After I arrive at my final destination I’ll look into it. Update:
    I am definitely missing my Eurocity train connection in Basel. That is certain.Yes,
    1h - 25%, 2h - 50% is the procedure with DB as well, I think it’s an European
    law. Stay and visit Basel, it’s a beautiful city. \U0001F604 (And it has the highest
    towers of \U0001F1E8\U0001F1ED.) I wish you good luck though, let’s hope the delay
    doesn’t increase anymore!"

If I didn’t have to be at my final destination, I would stay a bit in Basel. But it’s Switzerland. I’m sure there’s connections not long after and likely on time.

I don’t think those rates are EU wide, or if so they are minimums. A coworker of mine is traveling from France and they refund 30% in the TGV after 30 mins delay. And the [NS international website](https://www.nsinternational.com/en/after-the-journey/compensation-for-delays) has different rates for different operator delays.
