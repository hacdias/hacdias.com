Since Twitter is going to start charging for the usage of their API in a few days, I just [removed](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle/commit/a6fcc99502c4ceb1ea95ff061e39ad135ec234bb) all the Twitter related code from my website. To be fair, I haven't even used any Twitter-relating tooling on my website in months, so it's unlikely I will miss it.
