## Configuration

There are some peculiarities with my website's Hugo configuration. I use this section
of the README for future documentation for others, or if I myself forget.

### Pages

I have struggled with Hugo's way of dealing with pages, especially sections. I could
never create a nested page without having to create a section, and therefore a listing.
I designed my website and templates such that:

- A section is nothing more than a signal to Hugo to build nested pages.
- Section templates are treated as single page templates.
- Only taxonomy term pages are presented as lists.

Other important notes:

- The taxonomy "category" is a root-level taxonomy, e.g., `/articles/`.
- The page `/categories/` does not get rendered.
- All posts go into the `/posts/` section, which does not get rendered.
- All posts are built to `/yyyy/mm/dd/title/` URL.
